      "How can I get closer to understanding Truth if it's beyond words?"

      "What is intellectual Truth, and what is practical Truth?"
    ],
    "answer": "Intellectually, the Truth is the point where all the opposites meet and join to make a unity. Practically, the Truth is the surrender of the ego, to make possible the birth and manifestation of the Divine.",

      "How can I achieve peace for myself and others?"
    ],
    "answer": "All that happens is to teach us one and the same lesson, unless we get rid of our ego there is no peace either for ourselves or for others. And without ego life becomes such a wonderful marvel!...",

      "How can I ensure my life is guided by the Divine?"
    ],
    "answer": "Surrender: the decision to hand over the responsibility of your life to the Divine. This is done either through the mind or the emotion or the life-impulse or through all of them together.",

      "What happens when one truly surrenders to the Divine?",

      "What does it mean to truly love the Divine?",
      "What is the nature of pure love for the Divine?"
    ],
    "answer": "The true love for the Divine is self-giving, free of demand, full of submission and surrender. It makes no claim, imposes no condition, strikes no bargain, indulges in no violences of jealousy or pride or angerâ€”for these things are not in its composition.",

  },
  {
    "questions": [
      "What if I offer love to the Divine, but it doesn't seem to be accepted or things go wrong?"
    ],
    "answer": "When the true and sacred love is there (love *from* the Divine and *for* the Divine), whatever happens is always utilised as a means for increasing and perfecting the union. This leaves no place for worry, regret and depression, but, on the contrary, fills the consciousness with the certitude of victory.",

    "questions": [
      "How does judging others affect them and myself?",
      "Why should I avoid thinking badly of people?"
    ],
    "answer": "The first necessity is to abstain from thinking of anyone in a depreciatory way. When we meet a person, our criticising thoughts give to him, so to say, a blow on the nose which naturally creates a revolt in him. It is our mental formation that acts like a deforming mirror to that person.",

      "How do my inner errors affect the world around me?"
    ],
    "answer": "The ills that humanity suffers fromâ€”collectively and individuallyâ€”stem from the errors that lie at the roots of our ignorant nature. We must be cleansed of these evilsâ€”individually first of allâ€”if we ever hope to see a clean world outside.",

      "How much importance should I give to what other people think of me?"

    "questions": [
      "What does it mean if I feel hurt by what others say or do?"

  {
    "questions": [
      "How can I avoid getting into conflict when others have different viewpoints?"
    ],
    "answer": "The ego never understands that the Divine has different workings in different people and that to judge things from one's own egoistic point of view is a great mistake bound to increase the confusion.

      "Are friendships and intimate relationships a hindrance to spiritual practice?",
      "What is the risk of forming close human ties in sadhana?"
    ],
    "answer": "One must always be wary of the subconscious and that is why it is always preferable to have no particular friendships and intimacies, because in the subconscious vital, ties are established which form an obstacle to the sadhana.",

  },
  {
    "questions": [
      "How can I make my human relationships pure and helpful for my spiritual growth?"
    ],
    "answer": "It is true that it is extremely difficult to keep free from vital mixture any close relation with human beings. But the remedy is not to cut all such relations, but to be constantly vigilant (on one's guard) and not to allow the vital attractiveness to rule one's actions.",

      "What is my foremost duty if I have given myself to the Divine?",
      "Are family or social duties more important than my duty to the Divine?"
    ],
    "answer": "Duty towards the Divine is far more sacred than any social or family duty; it is all the more sacred because within the human collectivity it is almost wholly ignored or misunderstood. One who has given himself to the Divine has no longer any other duty than to make that consecration more and more perfect.",

      "What should be my attitude if the world misunderstands or condemns my spiritual path?"
    ],
    "answer": "You should not attempt to convince; above all, you should not let yourself be touched or shaken. You must shut yourself carefully within your ivory tower of consecration and await from the Divine alone help, protection, guidance and *approbation*. To be condemned by the whole world is nothing to him who knows that he has the approval of the Divine and his support.",

      "What truly makes women slaves, and how can they be liberated?"
    ],
    "answer": "No law can liberate women unless they liberate themselves. What makes them slaves is: (1) Attraction towards the male and his strength, (2) Desire for home life and its security, (3) Attachment to motherhood. If they get free from these three slaveries, they will truly be the equal of men.",

      "What is the true foundation of marriage beyond material and emotional aspects?"
    ],
    "answer": "To unite your physical lives, your material interests, to become partners... that is the very foundation of marriage, but... it is not enough. To be one in aspiration and ascension, to move forward at the same pace on the same spiritual path, that is the secret of a lasting union.",

  {
    "questions": [
      "Is getting married a direct way to prepare for sadhana?"
    ],
    "answer": "Marriage is not a direct way to prepare oneself for sadhana. It can be an indirect one if the outward nature needs troubles and disappointments to get rid of all worldly attachments, but in that case the experiment usually ends by separation and often a painful one.",

      "What is the significance of work in sadhana?"
    ],
    "answer": "Let us offer our work to the Divine; this is the sure means of progressing. Consciousness develops best through work done as an offering to the Divine. To work for the Divine is to pray with the body.",

      "How should I treat material objects I use?",
      "Is there a spiritual reason to take care of things?"
    ],
    "answer": "Not to take care of material things which one uses is a sign of inconscience and ignorance. You have no right to use any material object whatsoever if you do not take care of it. You must take care of it not because you are attached to it, but because it manifests something of the Divine Consciousness.",

    "questions": [
      "What is the origin and nature of Divine Love?",
      "Why did Love come into the manifestation?"
    ],
    "answer": "When Consciousness separated from its Origin and became Inconscience, the Origin emanated Love to reawaken Consciousness from the depth of the Inconscience and bring it back into touch with its Origin. It may be said that at its origin love is the supreme power of attraction which awakens, in response, the irresistible need of an absolute self-giving.",

    "questions": [
      "How can I recognize Divine Love if I don't feel it?"
    ],
    "answer": "Only he who loves can recognise love. Those who are incapable of giving themselves in a sincere love, will never recognise love anywhere, and the more the love is divine, that is to say, unselfish, the less they can recognise it.",

      "What is the consequence of trying to satisfy desires?",
      "How can I truly overcome my desires?"
    ],
    "answer": "Yielding to desires is not the way of getting rid of them. There is no end to desiresâ€”each one which is satisfied is at once replaced by another one and they go on clamouring more and more. It is only by conquering the desires that you can get rid of them, by coming out of this consciousness of the lower nature and rising to a higher consciousness.",

      "What is the main characteristic of the ego?",
      "How does the soul's awareness differ from the ego's?"
    ],

    ],
    "answer": "Here, for each work given, the full strength and Grace are always given at the same time to do the work as it has to be done. If you do not feel the strength and the Grace, it proves that there is some mistake in your attitude. The faith is lacking or you have fallen back on old tracks and old creeds and thus you lose all receptivity.",
