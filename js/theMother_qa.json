      "What is the nature of pure love for the Divine?"
    ],
    "answer": "The true love for the Divine is self-giving, free of demand, full of submission and surrender. It makes no claim, imposes no condition, strikes no bargain, indulges in no violences of jealousy or pride or anger—for these things are not in its composition.",

      "What if I offer love to the Divine, but it doesn't seem to be accepted or things go wrong?"
    ],
    "answer": "When the true and sacred love is there (love *from* the Divine and *for* the Divine), whatever happens is always utilised as a means for increasing and perfecting the union. This leaves no place for worry, regret and depression, but, on the contrary, fills the consciousness with the certitude of victory.",

      "How does judging others affect them and myself?",
      "Why should I avoid thinking badly of people?"
    ],
    "answer": "The first necessity is to abstain from thinking of anyone in a depreciatory way. When we meet a person, our criticising thoughts give to him, so to say, a blow on the nose which naturally creates a revolt in him. It is our mental formation that acts like a deforming mirror to that person.",

      "What does it mean if I feel hurt by what others say or do?"

      "How can I avoid getting into conflict when others have different viewpoints?"
    ],
    "answer": "The ego never understands that the Divine has different workings in different people and that to judge things from one's own egoistic point of view is a great mistake bound to increase the confusion.

      "How can I make my human relationships pure and helpful for my spiritual growth?"
    ],
    "answer": "It is true that it is extremely difficult to keep free from vital mixture any close relation with human beings. But the remedy is not to cut all such relations, but to be constantly vigilant (on one's guard) and not to allow the vital attractiveness to rule one's actions.",

      "Are family or social duties more important than my duty to the Divine?"
    ],
    "answer": "Duty towards the Divine is far more sacred than any social or family duty; it is all the more sacred because within the human collectivity it is almost wholly ignored or misunderstood. One who has given himself to the Divine has no longer any other duty than to make that consecration more and more perfect.",

      "What should be my attitude if the world misunderstands or condemns my spiritual path?"
    ],
    "answer": "You should not attempt to convince; above all, you should not let yourself be touched or shaken.

To be condemned by the whole world is nothing to him who knows that he has the approval of the Divine and his support.",

    "answer": "No law can liberate women unless they liberate themselves. What makes them slaves is: (1) Attraction towards the male and his strength, (2) Desire for home life and its security, (3) Attachment to motherhood. If they get free from these three slaveries, they will truly be the equal of men.",

    "answer": "To unite your physical lives, your material interests, to become partners... that is the very foundation of marriage, but... it is not enough. To be one in aspiration and ascension, to move forward at the same pace on the same spiritual path, that is the secret of a lasting union.",

      "Is getting married a direct way to prepare for sadhana?"
    ],
    "answer": "Marriage is not a direct way to prepare oneself for sadhana. It can be an indirect one if the outward nature needs troubles and disappointments to get rid of all worldly attachments, but in that case the experiment usually ends by separation and often a painful one.",

      "How should I treat material objects I use?",
      "Is there a spiritual reason to take care of things?"
    ],
    "answer": "Not to take care of material things which one uses is a sign of inconscience and ignorance. You have no right to use any material object whatsoever if you do not take care of it. You must take care of it not because you are attached to it, but because it manifests something of the Divine Consciousness.",

      "Why did Love come into the manifestation?"
    ],
    "answer": "When Consciousness separated from its Origin and became Inconscience, the Origin emanated Love to reawaken Consciousness from the depth of the Inconscience and bring it back into touch with its Origin. It may be said that at its origin love is the supreme power of attraction which awakens, in response, the irresistible need of an absolute self-giving.",

      "How can I recognize Divine Love if I don't feel it?"

    "answer": "Yielding to desires is not the way of getting rid of them. There is no end to desires—each one which is satisfied is at once replaced by another one and they go on clamouring more and more. It is only by conquering the desires that you can get rid of them, by coming out of this consciousness of the lower nature and rising to a higher consciousness.",

      "How does the soul's awareness differ from the ego's?"

If you do not feel the strength and the Grace, it proves that there is some mistake in your attitude.
