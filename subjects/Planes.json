These are not merely physical locations but states of being, experienced according to one's karma, spiritual development, and the nature of one's subtle constitution (Shariras and Koshas). Understanding these planes is crucial for comprehending the soul's journey and the path to ultimate liberation (Moksha)."

Each plane is a field of experience governed by specific laws and inhabited by beings whose consciousness resonates with that plane's vibrational frequency."
