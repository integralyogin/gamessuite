It is primarily concerned with the cultivation of mind mastery ('chitta vritti nirodha' – the cessation of mental fluctuations) through a comprehensive eight-limbed path of ethical conduct, physical discipline, breath control, sensory withdrawal, and progressive stages of meditation, ultimately leading to the direct perception of the true Self (Purusha) and liberation (Kaivalya) from the cycle of suffering."

'Vrittis' are the constant fluctuations, modifications, or thought-waves that arise in the Chitta, categorized into five types (correct knowledge, misconception, imagination, sleep, memory). The primary aim of Raja Yoga is 'Chitta Vritti Nirodha' – the calming and eventual cessation of these mental modifications to reveal the underlying stillness and luminosity of the true Self (Purusha)."

All manifest phenomena, including the mind and its states, are a result of the varying combinations and interactions of these three Gunas.
