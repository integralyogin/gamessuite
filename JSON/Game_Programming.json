"Game Loop": { "quote": "The core iteration cycle that runs continuously: process input, update game state, render output. Every frame in a game passes through this loop." },
"Entity Component System": { "quote": "A compositional architecture that separates data from behavior. Unity's ECS allows for efficient processing of thousands of game objects." },
"Physics Engines": { "quote": "Systems for realistic movement and collision simulations. Box2D (used in Angry Birds) and PhysX (used in Unreal) handle complex physics calculations." },
"Rendering Pipeline": { "quote": "The sequence of steps to convert 3D scene data into 2D images. Modern graphics pipelines use techniques like deferred rendering to handle complex lighting." },
"Shaders": { "quote": "Specialized programs that run on the GPU for visual effects. Cel shaders in Borderlands create the distinctive comic book aesthetic." },
"Input Handling": { "quote": "Processing and responding to player controls. Well-designed input systems account for different platforms and control schemes." },

"Pathfinding": { "quote": "Algorithms to navigate environments. A* pathfinding helps NPCs find routes through game worlds in Civilization and RTS games." },
"Networking": { "quote": "Code for multiplayer experiences. Rollback netcode in fighting games like Street Fighter V compensates for latency in online play." },
"AI Systems": { "quote": "Simulating intelligent behavior for non-player entities. Behavior trees in Halo manage complex enemy decision-making processes." },
"Memory Management": { "quote": "Efficient allocation and use of system resources. Optimization techniques like object pooling reuse game objects instead of creating and destroying them." },
"State Machines": { "quote": "Models for organizing entity behavior into discrete states. Character controllers often use state machines to manage animations and actions." },
"Procedural Generation": { "quote": "Algorithmically creating content rather than manually crafting it. No Man's Sky generates planets, creatures, and ecosystems through procedural algorithms." },
"Asset Pipeline": { "quote": "Tools and workflows for importing and processing game content. Efficient pipelines convert raw art assets into optimized game-ready formats." },
"Level Streaming": { "quote": "Loading and unloading parts of the game world as needed. Open world games like Red Dead Redemption 2 stream environments seamlessly as players traverse the map." },
"Serialization": { "quote": "Converting game state to storable formats for saving and loading. Save systems must reliably preserve complex game states between sessions." },
"Performance Profiling": { "quote": "Identifying and resolving bottlenecks in game code. Tools like Unity Profiler help developers locate processing-intensive operations." },
"Threading": { "quote": "Utilizing multiple CPU cores for parallel processing. Modern game engines distribute tasks like physics, AI, and rendering across separate threads." },
"Animation Systems": { "quote": "Code that controls character and object movement. Inverse kinematics in The Last of Us Part II creates realistic body positioning for characters." },
"Scripting Languages": { "quote": "Higher-level languages for gameplay logic. Lua in World of Warcraft allows for modding and extensibility without accessing core engine code." },
"Audio Programming": { "quote": "Systems for sound effect and music playback. Dynamic audio engines like FMOD adapt music and effects based on gameplay situations." },
"UI Programming": { "quote": "Creating and managing interface elements. Modern UI frameworks use data-binding and component architectures for maintainable interfaces." },
