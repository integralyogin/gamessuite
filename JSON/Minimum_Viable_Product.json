"MVP Definition": { "quote": "The version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future development. (Eric Ries, The Lean Startup)" },
"Value Proposition": { "quote": "The core problem your product solves and the primary benefit it delivers to users. A clear value proposition is essential before any MVP development begins." },
"Core Functionality": { "quote": "The minimum set of features required to address the main user need. Dropbox's initial MVP was a simple video demonstrating the file synchronization concept." },
"Build-Measure-Learn": { "quote": "The fundamental cycle of validated learning where you quickly build an MVP, measure user response, and learn from the results. (Lean Startup Methodology)" },
"Feature Prioritization": { "quote": "The process of distinguishing must-have features from nice-to-have features. The MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) helps focus MVP development." },
"User Feedback Loop": { "quote": "The systematic collection and incorporation of user feedback to guide product iterations. Early versions of Gmail remained in beta for years while iterating based on user feedback." },
"Rapid Iteration": { "quote": "Quick, incremental improvements based on real user data. Facebook's early MVP focused solely on college students before expanding features and audience." },
"Market Validation": { "quote": "Confirming that a market exists for your solution before investing in full development. Zappos began as a simple website with photos of shoes from local stores to validate demand." },
"Risk Reduction": { "quote": "Minimizing investment in unproven ideas by testing core assumptions early. Buffer validated their concept with a simple landing page before building the actual product." },
"Technical Debt": { "quote": "Shortcuts taken during MVP development that must eventually be addressed. Balancing speed with sustainable architecture is a key MVP challenge." },
"Concierge MVP": { "quote": "Manually delivering the core service to gain insights before automating. Aardvark tested their Q&A concept by manually routing questions via IM before building their platform." },
"Wizard of Oz MVP": { "quote": "A facade that appears automated but has humans performing functions behind the scenes. Early versions of StitchFix had stylists manually selecting items while appearing algorithmic." },
"Landing Page MVP": { "quote": "A simple webpage describing the product and gauging interest through sign-ups. Robinhood collected nearly one million email addresses before launching their commission-free trading app." },
"Piecemeal MVP": { "quote": "Using existing tools and services to deliver your solution before building custom technology. Groupon began as a WordPress blog with PDFs delivered via email." },
"Single-Feature MVP": { "quote": "Focusing on one core feature exceptionally well rather than many features poorly. Instagram launched with only photo sharing and filters before adding video and stories." },
"Explainer Video MVP": { "quote": "A video demonstration of how the product would work to gauge interest. Dropbox gained 70,000 sign-ups overnight from their explainer video before the product was built." },
"Smoke Test": { "quote": "Testing market demand by creating advertising for a product that doesn't yet exist. Tim Ferriss validated The 4-Hour Work Week by running Google ads to different potential titles." },
"Prototype vs. MVP": { "quote": "A prototype demonstrates technical feasibility while an MVP tests market viability. Prototypes are internal tools; MVPs are customer-facing products." },
"Success Metrics": { "quote": "Predefined key performance indicators that determine if an MVP is successful. Metrics should focus on user behavior rather than vanity metrics like page views." },
"Pivot Point": { "quote": "When MVP data indicates a need to change direction. Slack began as an internal tool for a game development company before pivoting to a communication platform." },
"Scope Management": { "quote": "Ruthlessly eliminating features that aren't essential to the core value proposition. The first iPhone launched without copy/paste functionality, focusing instead on revolutionary touch interface." },
"User Experience": { "quote": "Even an MVP should provide a complete user experience, though limited in scope. Usability matters even in early versions." },
"Continuous Deployment": { "quote": "The practice of releasing updates frequently rather than in major releases. This allows for faster feedback cycles essential to MVP methodology." },
"Feature Creep Resistance": { "quote": "The discipline to avoid adding non-essential features during MVP development. The question 'Is this necessary for launch?' helps maintain focus." },
"Investment Efficiency": { "quote": "Maximizing learning while minimizing resource expenditure. An effective MVP generates maximum insights per development dollar spent." },
"Problem-Solution Fit": { "quote": "Validating that your solution effectively addresses the problem you've identified. This precedes product-market fit in the startup lifecycle." },
"Product-Market Fit": { "quote": "The degree to which a product satisfies strong market demand. MVPs help determine whether product-market fit exists." },
"Scaling Considerations": { "quote": "Understanding which aspects of an MVP can scale and which will require reimagining as user numbers grow. Twitter's early 'fail whale' highlighted scaling challenges." },
"Documentation": { "quote": "Recording hypotheses, tests, and learnings throughout the MVP process. This creates an evidence trail for future decision-making." },
"Ethical Considerations": { "quote": "Ensuring that even minimal products maintain ethical standards and user trust. Being transparent about a product's MVP status sets appropriate expectations." }
