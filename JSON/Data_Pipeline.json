"Data Extraction": { "quote": "Retrieving data from sources in raw or specific formats. ETL tools extract structured data from relational databases via SQL queries or CDC mechanisms." },
"Data Validation": { "quote": "Verifying data quality, completeness, and conformity to expected patterns. Great Expectations and Deequ libraries implement data quality rules and assertions." },
"Data Cleansing": { "quote": "Identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies. OpenRefine and Python libraries remove duplicates, fix formatting issues, and standardize values." },
"Data Transformation": { "quote": "Converting data from one format or structure to another. Apache Spark and dbt transform raw data into analytically useful formats through SQL or code." },
"Data Normalization": { "quote": "Organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity. Database normalization converts denormalized event data into properly modeled relational tables." },
"Data Enrichment": { "quote": "Adding value by combining data with additional context or information. Joining transaction data with customer profiles or third-party demographic information." },
"Data Storage": { "quote": "Persisting processed data in appropriate repositories. Data lakes like S3 or HDFS store raw data while data warehouses like Snowflake store processed data." },
"Data Cataloging": { "quote": "Organizing metadata about datasets for discovery and governance. Tools like Amundsen and DataHub track data lineage and document dataset properties." },
"Data Modeling": { "quote": "Creating structured representations of data and relationships. Star schemas with fact and dimension tables optimize for analytical query performance." },
"Data Orchestration": { "quote": "Coordinating and automating pipeline components and workflows. Apache Airflow and Prefect schedule jobs, handle dependencies, and monitor execution." },
"Data Processing": { "quote": "Performing computations and transformations on data. Batch processing with Spark or stream processing with Flink handles large-scale data operations." },
"Stream Processing": { "quote": "Processing data continuously as it arrives in real-time. Kafka Streams and Flink process event streams with sub-second latency for real-time insights." },
"Batch Processing": { "quote": "Processing accumulated data in scheduled or triggered intervals. Overnight ETL jobs process daily transaction data for morning business reports." },
"Data Integration": { "quote": "Combining data from different sources into a unified view. ELT processes consolidate operational data from various systems into a centralized warehouse." },
"Data Governance": { "quote": "Managing availability, usability, integrity, and security of data. Data catalogs, access controls, and audit logs enforce policies and compliance." },
"Data Quality": { "quote": "Measuring and ensuring data meets standards for use. Data quality frameworks assess completeness, accuracy, consistency, and timeliness." },
"Data Lineage": { "quote": "Tracking data origin, movements, and transformations over time. Lineage tools visualize how data flows from source systems through transformations." },
"Data Versioning": { "quote": "Managing changes to datasets over time. Delta Lake and Iceberg track versions of datasets for time travel and reproducibility." },
"Pipeline Monitoring": { "quote": "Tracking pipeline health, performance, and SLAs. Dashboards and alerts notify when data freshness or quality metrics fall outside thresholds." },
"Error Handling": { "quote": "Detecting and managing failures within the pipeline. Dead letter queues capture and isolate problematic records for later reprocessing." },
"Data Serving": { "quote": "Making processed data available to end-users and applications. APIs, dashboards, and ML feature stores deliver data to consumption points." },
"Data Visualization": { "quote": "Representing data graphically to facilitate understanding. Tableau and PowerBI create interactive dashboards from processed data." },
