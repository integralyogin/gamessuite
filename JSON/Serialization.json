"Definition": { "quote": "The process of converting data structures or object states into a format that can be stored or transmitted and reconstructed later." },
"Object Serialization": { "quote": "Transforming in-memory objects into a storable or transmittable format. In Java: ObjectOutputStream.writeObject() converts objects to byte streams." },
"Deserialization": { "quote": "The reverse process of reconstructing data structures from serialized formats. In Python: json.loads() converts JSON strings back to Python objects." },
"JSON Serialization": { "quote": "Converting data to JavaScript Object Notation format. JSON.stringify({name: 'Alice'}) creates a portable text representation." },
"XML Serialization": { "quote": "Encoding data using Extensible Markup Language. <person><name>Alice</name></person> represents hierarchical data with tags." },
"Binary Serialization": { "quote": "Conversion to machine-readable binary format for efficiency. Protocol Buffers encode data in a compact, high-performance binary representation." },
"Protocol Buffers": { "quote": "Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. message Person { string name = 1; } defines a schema." },
"YAML Serialization": { "quote": "Human-readable data serialization standard. name: Alice age: 30 creates readable configuration files." },
"CSV Serialization": { "quote": "Storing tabular data in comma-separated values format. name,age,email encodes spreadsheet-like information." },
"Avro": { "quote": "Apache data serialization system with schema-based, compact binary format. Includes schema in data, enabling schema evolution." },
"MessagePack": { "quote": "Binary serialization format that's more compact than JSON. Optimized for data transmission and storage efficiency." },
"BSON": { "quote": "Binary JSON format used by MongoDB for document storage. Extends JSON with additional data types." },
"Pickle": { "quote": "Python-specific protocol for serializing objects. pickle.dumps() converts Python objects to byte streams." },
"Marshalling": { "quote": "Converting object data to a standard format for transmission between systems. Often used in remote procedure calls." },
"Serialization Security": { "quote": "Protecting against deserialization attacks. Java's ObjectInputFilter prevents malicious objects during reconstruction." },
"Schema Evolution": { "quote": "Managing changes to data structures over time. Avro and Protocol Buffers support backward/forward compatibility." },
"Serialized Form": { "quote": "The specific representation of data after serialization. In JSON: {\"name\":\"Alice\",\"age\":30} represents person data." },
"Cross-Language Serialization": { "quote": "Formats that work across programming languages. JSON, XML, and Protocol Buffers enable heterogeneous system communication." },
"Serializable Interface": { "quote": "Programming contracts for objects that can be serialized. Java's java.io.Serializable marks classes for serialization support." },
"Data Transfer Objects": { "quote": "Simple objects designed for serialization. DTOs contain only data with no behavior for clean transmission." },
"Custom Serialization": { "quote": "Implementing specialized conversion logic. Java's writeObject and readObject methods enable custom serialization behavior." },
"Serialization Frameworks": { "quote": "Libraries that handle serialization processes. Jackson, GSON, and Newtonsoft.JSON abstract away serialization complexity." },
"Serialization Performance": { "quote": "Efficiency of conversion processes. Binary formats like Protocol Buffers offer better performance than text-based formats like XML." },
"Version Tolerance": { "quote": "Handling serialized data across different software versions. Thrift includes version numbers to manage schema changes." },
"Serializable Closures": { "quote": "Functions that can be serialized with their environment. PHP's serialize() can capture closures for later execution." },
"Deep vs. Shallow Serialization": { "quote": "Whether referenced objects are included. Deep serialization includes all object references recursively." },
"Streaming Serialization": { "quote": "Processing data incrementally without loading everything into memory. SAX parsers read XML sequentially for large documents." },
