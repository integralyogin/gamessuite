"Architecture": { "quote": "The high-level structure that defines how code components interact. Well-architected systems separate concerns through layers, modules, and services." },
"Clean Code": { "quote": "Code that is easy to understand and maintain. Functions should do one thing, be small, and have descriptive names." },
"Technical Debt": { "quote": "The implied cost of future rework caused by choosing expedient solutions. Like financial debt, it accrues interest in the form of development friction." },
"Code Smells": { "quote": "Indicators of potential problems in code. Long methods, duplicate code, and large classes often signal deeper design issues." },
"Refactoring": { "quote": "Restructuring existing code without changing external behavior. The boy scout rule: leave the code cleaner than you found it." },
"Version Control": { "quote": "Systems that track changes to source code over time. Git enables collaborative development through branching, merging, and commit history." },
"Continuous Integration": { "quote": "The practice of frequently merging code changes into a shared repository. Automated builds and tests verify each integration." },
"Continuous Deployment": { "quote": "Automatically releasing code to production after passing automated tests. Small, frequent releases reduce risk and provide faster feedback." },
"Testing": { "quote": "Verifying code functionality through automated checks. Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests provide a safety net for changes." },
"Test-Driven Development": { "quote": "Writing tests before implementation code. Red-green-refactor: test fails, make it pass, improve the solution." },
"Code Review": { "quote": "Examining code changes before integration. Reviews improve quality, share knowledge, and ensure consistency." },
"Documentation": { "quote": "Materials that explain code purpose and usage. Good documentation answers 'why' more than 'what' or 'how'." },
"Modularity": { "quote": "Organizing code into independent, interchangeable components. High cohesion within modules, loose coupling between them." },
"Design Patterns": { "quote": "Reusable solutions to common problems. Patterns like Factory, Observer, and Strategy provide shared vocabulary for developers." },
"SOLID Principles": { "quote": "Guidelines for maintainable object-oriented design. Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, Dependency inversion." },
"Dependency Management": { "quote": "Handling external code libraries and frameworks. Package managers track versions and resolve dependency trees." },
"Code Style": { "quote": "Conventions for formatting and structuring code. Consistent style improves readability and reduces cognitive load." },
"Static Analysis": { "quote": "Examining code without execution to find issues. Linters and code quality tools provide automated feedback." },
"Performance Optimization": { "quote": "Improving execution efficiency and resource usage. Profile before optimizing; premature optimization is the root of all evil." },
"Security Practices": { "quote": "Protecting against vulnerabilities and attacks. Secure coding principles include input validation, least privilege, and defense in depth." },
"Scalability": { "quote": "Ability to handle growing demands on the system. Horizontally scalable architectures distribute load across multiple instances." },
"Maintainability": { "quote": "Ease of making changes and fixes over time. Maintainable code is readable, testable, and follows consistent patterns." },
"Legacy Code": { "quote": "Valuable older code lacking tests or documentation. Working effectively with legacy code requires incremental improvement strategies." },
"Code Metrics": { "quote": "Quantitative measures of code characteristics. Cyclomatic complexity, coupling, and test coverage provide insights into quality." },
"DevOps": { "quote": "Culture and practices unifying development and operations. Infrastructure as code treats system configuration like application code." },
"Microservices": { "quote": "Architecture style building applications as service collections. Each service is independently deployable and focused on specific functionality." },
"Monolithic Architecture": { "quote": "Single-tiered application where components are interconnected. Simplifies development workflow but can grow unwieldy at scale." },
"Technical Documentation": { "quote": "Records describing system implementation and decisions. Architecture diagrams, API specs, and decision logs preserve knowledge." },
"Code Ownership": { "quote": "Responsibility patterns for maintaining code components. Collective ownership encourages shared responsibility across the team." },
"Codebase Health": { "quote": "Overall quality and sustainability of the code. Regular maintenance, refactoring, and retiring obsolete code maintain long-term health." }
