"Definition": { "quote": "A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that can be saved and reused. CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployees() BEGIN SELECT * FROM employees; END;" },
"Parameters": { "quote": "Input and output values passed to procedures. CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeesByDept(IN deptId INT) BEGIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = deptId; END;" },
"Return Values": { "quote": "Data returned from procedure execution. RETURNS clause in SQL Server, OUT parameters in MySQL, or function return values in PostgreSQL." },
"Execution": { "quote": "How procedures are invoked. CALL GetEmployeesByDept(5); or EXECUTE sp_GetEmployees;" },
"Conditional Logic": { "quote": "Control flow within procedures. IF-ELSE, CASE statements determine execution paths based on conditions." },
"Error Handling": { "quote": "Managing exceptions and errors. TRY-CATCH blocks in SQL Server, DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER in MySQL." },
"Transactions": { "quote": "Ensuring data integrity during procedure execution. BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK maintain ACID properties." },
"Cursor Operations": { "quote": "Iterating through result sets within procedures. DECLARE, OPEN, FETCH, CLOSE for row-by-row processing." },
"Performance Benefits": { "quote": "Execution plans are cached, reducing parsing overhead. Network traffic is reduced by sending single procedure call instead of multiple queries." },
"Security Advantages": { "quote": "Granular permissions can be granted on procedure level rather than underlying tables. GRANT EXECUTE ON procedure_name TO user_name;" },
"Modularity": { "quote": "Complex logic encapsulated within reusable units. Business rules centralized in database layer." },
"Maintenance": { "quote": "Single point of update for shared functionality. Changes to procedures don't require application redeployment." },
"Versioning": { "quote": "Tracking and managing procedure changes. Some systems use naming conventions like sp_name_v2 or schema-based versioning." },
"System Procedures": { "quote": "Built-in procedures for database administration. sp_helpindex, sp_who2 in SQL Server or information_schema procedures in MySQL." },
"Nested Procedures": { "quote": "Calling procedures from within other procedures. Modular design enables code reuse and logical separation." },
"Recursive Procedures": { "quote": "Self-referencing procedures for hierarchical data. Common for traversing organizational charts or bill-of-materials." },
"Temporary Tables": { "quote": "Creating and using temporary storage within procedures. CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE tmp_results for intermediate processing." },
"Table Variables": { "quote": "Memory-resident tables for procedure processing. DECLARE @MyTable TABLE (col1 INT, col2 VARCHAR(50));" },
"Dynamic SQL": { "quote": "Building and executing SQL statements at runtime. EXEC sp_executesql @sql_statement;" },
"Procedure Caching": { "quote": "How database engines store and reuse execution plans. Plan reuse significantly improves repeat performance." },
"Procedure Dependencies": { "quote": "Tracking objects referenced by procedures. Database engines maintain dependency information for impact analysis." },
"Procedure Metadata": { "quote": "Information about procedure definitions stored in system catalogs. sys.procedures, information_schema.routines." },
"CLR Integration": { "quote": "Extending procedures with programming languages. SQL Server allows .NET languages, PostgreSQL supports multiple languages with PL interfaces." },
"Batching Operations": { "quote": "Grouping multiple DML operations. Reduced overhead for bulk data changes." },
"Output Formatting": { "quote": "Customizing result set structure within procedures. Column selection, aliasing, and transformation for consistent client consumption." },
"Procedure Limitations": { "quote": "Understanding restrictions in different database systems. Size limits, nesting depth, and feature support vary across platforms." },
"Debugging Techniques": { "quote": "Troubleshooting procedure execution. PRINT statements, logging tables, or integrated debuggers in management tools." },
"Performance Monitoring": { "quote": "Tracking procedure execution metrics. Execution statistics, duration measurements, and resource consumption." },
"Encryption": { "quote": "Protecting procedure code from unauthorized viewing. WITH ENCRYPTION option in SQL Server obscures the procedure definition." },
"Best Practices": { "quote": "Guidelines for effective procedure design. Proper error handling, parameter validation, and documentation are essential." }
