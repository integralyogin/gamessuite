"Logical Data Model": { "quote": "Detailed structure independent of database platform. A logical model specifies entities, attributes, keys, and relationships without physical considerations." },
"Physical Data Model": { "quote": "Implementation-specific details for a particular database. Table definitions, column names, data types, indexes, and constraints reflect DBMS optimization." },
"Entity-Relationship Model": { "quote": "Entities, attributes, and relationships visualized in diagrams. The classic Chen notation uses rectangles for entities and diamonds for relationships." },
"Relational Model": { "quote": "Data organized in tables with rows and columns. Normalization reduces redundancy through decomposition into multiple related tables." },
"Dimensional Model": { "quote": "Structure optimized for data warehousing and analytics. Star schema organizes data into facts (metrics) and dimensions (context) for efficient querying." },
"Hierarchical Model": { "quote": "Tree-like structure with parent-child relationships. XML documents naturally represent hierarchical data with nested elements." },
"Network Model": { "quote": "Flexible structure allowing many-to-many relationships. Graph databases model complex interconnected data like social networks." },
"Object-Oriented Model": { "quote": "Modeling data as objects with properties and methods. Object-relational mapping bridges the gap between object-oriented code and relational databases." },
"Document Model": { "quote": "Schema-flexible approach for semi-structured data. MongoDB stores JSON-like documents that can vary in structure within the same collection." },
"Key-Value Model": { "quote": "Simple pairs of identifiers and values. Redis provides high-performance storage through this straightforward approach." },
"Column-Family Model": { "quote": "Columnar storage for wide, sparse tables. Cassandra efficiently handles distributed data with column families." },
"Graph Model": { "quote": "Nodes, edges, and properties representing networks. Neo4j excels at traversing relationships for connected data analysis." },
"Time Series Model": { "quote": "Sequential data points indexed by time. InfluxDB optimizes for timestamped metrics common in monitoring applications." },
"Normalization": { "quote": "Process of organizing data to reduce redundancy. Third normal form eliminates transitive dependencies among non-key attributes." },
"Denormalization": { "quote": "Strategic redundancy for performance improvement. Pre-calculated aggregates speed up analytical queries at the cost of update complexity." },
"Cardinality": { "quote": "The numerical relationship between entity instances. One-to-many, many-to-many, and one-to-one relationships define table connections." },
"Primary Key": { "quote": "Unique identifier for each record in a table. Social security numbers, ISBN codes, and synthetic sequences serve as entity identifiers." },
"Foreign Key": { "quote": "Reference to a primary key in another table. Order_items.order_id references orders.id to maintain referential integrity." },
"Constraints": { "quote": "Rules enforcing data integrity. Check constraints, unique constraints, and not-null constraints maintain valid data." },
"Indexes": { "quote": "Data structures speeding up record retrieval. B-tree indexes optimize searching and sorting operations." },
"Data Dictionary": { "quote": "Repository of metadata about the database. Column names, data types, descriptions, and business rules document the model." },
