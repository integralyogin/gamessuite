"Map Data Structure": { "quote": "An abstract data type that stores key-value pairs, allowing retrieval by key. map[key] = value abstracts associative relationships." },
"Hash Map": { "quote": "Uses a hash function to compute indices for key-value storage. O(1) average time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations." },
"Hash Function": { "quote": "Converts keys into array indices for efficient retrieval. Good hash functions minimize collisions while distributing values uniformly." },
"Collision Resolution": { "quote": "Techniques to handle multiple keys mapping to the same index. Separate chaining uses linked lists while open addressing finds alternative slots." },
"Dictionary": { "quote": "A specific implementation of the map abstract data type. Python dictionaries provide flexible key-value storage with dynamic resizing." },
"TreeMap": { "quote": "Map implementation using a self-balancing binary search tree. Java TreeMap guarantees O(log n) operations with ordered key traversal." },
"Ordered Map": { "quote": "Maintains key ordering for sequential access. std::map in C++ preserves key order for consistent iteration." },
"Unordered Map": { "quote": "Prioritizes performance over key ordering. std::unordered_map in C++ offers faster lookups but doesn't maintain key order." },
"MultiMap": { "quote": "Allows multiple values to be associated with a single key. C++'s std::multimap accommodates duplicate keys for one-to-many relationships." },
"Load Factor": { "quote": "Ratio of filled slots to total capacity. Most implementations trigger resizing when load factor exceeds a threshold (e.g., 0.75)." },
"Rehashing": { "quote": "Process of resizing and redistributing entries. When load factor exceeds threshold, map capacity increases and entries are rehashed." },
"Implementation Variations": { "quote": "Different programming languages implement maps as hashtables, dictionaries, associative arrays, or objects." },
"Map Operations": { "quote": "Common operations include get, put, remove, containsKey, and size with varying time complexities by implementation." },
"Concurrent HashMap": { "quote": "Thread-safe implementation for parallel access. Java's ConcurrentHashMap allows multiple threads to read and write safely." },
"Open Addressing": { "quote": "Collision resolution by finding alternative slots. Linear probing checks adjacent slots sequentially when collisions occur." },
"Separate Chaining": { "quote": "Collision resolution using linked lists at each bucket. Each hash table slot contains a linked list of all entries with that hash." },
"Map Iteration": { "quote": "Traversing key-value pairs sequentially. JavaScript's Map.forEach() and for...of provide iteration mechanisms." },
"Immutable Map": { "quote": "Unchangeable map implementation for functional programming. Immutable.js and Scala provide persistent data structures." },
"Bidirectional Map": { "quote": "Allows efficient lookup by either key or value. Guava's BiMap ensures unique values and supports inverse views." },
"Weak Map": { "quote": "Holds weak references to keys for memory management. JavaScript's WeakMap allows garbage collection of unreferenced keys." },
"Linked HashMap": { "quote": "Preserves insertion order while maintaining hash table performance. Java's LinkedHashMap combines linked list and hash table structures." },
"Skip List Map": { "quote": "Probabilistic alternative to balanced trees. Multiple linked lists with skip pointers enable O(log n) operations." },
"Persistent Map": { "quote": "Creates new version on modifications while preserving originals. Immutable data structures in Clojure and Scala optimize memory usage." },
"Specialized Maps": { "quote": "Domain-specific implementations like EnumMap, IdentityHashMap, or NavigableMap serve particular use cases." },
"JSON Object": { "quote": "JavaScript Object Notation represents maps with string keys. {\"name\": \"value\"} provides a human-readable serialization format." },
