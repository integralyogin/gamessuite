"Definition": { "quote": "A data mart is a subset of a data warehouse focused on a specific business line or team's needs." },
"Types of Data Marts": { "quote": "Dependent, Independent, and Hybrid data marts serve different architectural needs." },
"Dependent Data Marts": { "quote": "Source data exclusively from enterprise data warehouse, ensuring data consistency." },
"Independent Data Marts": { "quote": "Standalone systems sourced directly from operational systems or external data." },
"Hybrid Data Marts": { "quote": "Combine data from both warehouse and operational sources for flexibility." },
"Architecture Patterns": { "quote": "Star schema, snowflake schema, and constellation schema organize mart structures." },
"Star Schema": { "quote": "Central fact table connected to dimension tables, optimized for querying." },
"Snowflake Schema": { "quote": "Normalized dimension tables branch from fact table, reducing redundancy." },
"Data Granularity": { "quote": "Level of detail in fact tables determines analysis capabilities." },
"ETL Process": { "quote": "Extract, Transform, Load processes populate and maintain data mart content." },
"Business Functions": { "quote": "Sales, Marketing, Finance, HR each may have specialized data marts." },
"Data Quality": { "quote": "Cleansing, validation, and consistency checks maintain mart integrity." },
"Performance Optimization": { "quote": "Indexes, partitioning, and aggregates improve query response time." },
"Security Controls": { "quote": "Access controls, encryption, and auditing protect sensitive mart data." },
"Metadata Management": { "quote": "Business and technical metadata document mart contents and usage." },
"Data Refresh": { "quote": "Scheduled or real-time updates keep mart data current with source systems." },
"Size Considerations": { "quote": "Typically smaller than data warehouse, focused on specific subject areas." },
"Query Patterns": { "quote": "OLAP, reporting, and ad-hoc analysis drive mart design decisions." },
"Integration Points": { "quote": "Connections to BI tools, reporting systems, and analytical applications." },
"Data Modeling": { "quote": "Dimensional modeling techniques optimize for business analysis." },
"Maintenance": { "quote": "Regular updates, cleanup, and optimization maintain mart performance." },
"Storage Options": { "quote": "Traditional databases, columnar stores, or cloud platforms host mart data." },
"Data Governance": { "quote": "Policies and procedures ensure proper mart usage and maintenance." },
"Cost Factors": { "quote": "Hardware, software, development, and ongoing maintenance impact TCO." },
"Implementation Strategy": { "quote": "Top-down from DW or bottom-up from source systems guide development." },
"Change Management": { "quote": "Schema evolution, business changes, and source updates require careful handling." },
"Performance Metrics": { "quote": "Query response time, data freshness, and resource utilization measure success." },
"Scalability": { "quote": "Design must accommodate growing data volumes and user demands." },
"Best Practices": { "quote": "Standardization, documentation, and testing ensure mart quality." },
"Future Trends": { "quote": "Cloud deployment, real-time analytics, and AI integration shape evolution." }
