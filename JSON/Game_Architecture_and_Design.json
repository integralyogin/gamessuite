"AI Architecture": { "quote": "Game AI should create the illusion of intelligence while serving gameplay needs rather than pursuing 'true' AI." },
"Audio Systems": { "quote": "Sound architecture should support dynamic audio that responds to player actions and game state changes." },
"Input Handling": { "quote": "Robust input systems must support multiple devices, control schemes, and provide appropriate feedback to player actions." },
"Network Architecture": { "quote": "Multiplayer systems must address latency, synchronization, and security while maintaining gameplay integrity." },
"Resource Management": { "quote": "Asset loading, caching, and streaming systems are crucial for managing large game worlds and reducing load times." },
