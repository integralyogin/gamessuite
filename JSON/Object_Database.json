{
"Object Model": { "quote": "The fundamental paradigm representing real-world entities as objects with attributes, methods, and relationships. Objects encapsulate both data and behavior." },
"Object Identity": { "quote": "Each object has a unique identifier independent of its attribute values. Unlike relational databases where identity is tied to primary keys, object identity remains constant regardless of state changes." },
"Complex Objects": { "quote": "Support for composite structures where objects can contain other objects or collections. A Document object may contain multiple Section objects, which in turn contain Paragraph objects." },
"Inheritance": { "quote": "Objects can inherit attributes and methods from parent classes. A SavingsAccount inherits from BankAccount while adding interest rate functionality." },
"Polymorphism": { "quote": "The ability to treat objects of different classes through a common interface. A collection of Shape objects can include Circles, Rectangles, and Triangles, all responding to a draw() method." },
"Encapsulation": { "quote": "Objects hide internal state and require interaction through defined methods. Account.withdraw() enforces business rules before modifying the balance attribute." },
"Object Query Language": { "quote": "Languages designed to query objects and their relationships. OQL allows traversing object graphs: SELECT p.name FROM Persons p WHERE p.address.city = 'New York'" },
"Object-Relational Mapping": { "quote": "Techniques to translate between object-oriented models and relational databases. Hibernate maps Java objects to database tables while preserving object-oriented semantics." },
"Schema Evolution": { "quote": "The ability to modify the structure of classes while preserving existing objects. Adding a new attribute to Customer need not require modification of existing Customer objects." },
"Persistence": { "quote": "The automated storage and retrieval of objects without explicit conversion. Objects are saved in their native form without transformation to tables." },
"Transactions": { "quote": "ACID guarantees for operations that create, update, or delete objects. Multiple object modifications can be committed or rolled back as a single unit of work." },
"Indexes": { "quote": "Data structures that optimize object retrieval based on attribute values. Indexing Person.lastName speeds retrieval of people with a specific surname." },
"Navigational Access": { "quote": "Traversing between related objects directly through their references. From Order to Customer to Address without explicit joins." },
"Collection Types": { "quote": "Native support for arrays, lists, sets, and maps as first-class object attributes. A Department object contains a collection of Employee objects with appropriate collection semantics." },
"Versioning": { "quote": "Tracking changes to objects over time and allowing access to previous states. Document versioning enables viewing the evolution of content and reverting to earlier versions." },
"Method Execution": { "quote": "The ability to execute object methods within the database environment. Validating business rules inside the database before data modification." },
"Object Caching": { "quote": "Optimizing performance by keeping frequently accessed objects in memory. Recently retrieved Customer objects remain accessible without database retrieval." },
"Distribution": { "quote": "Supporting objects that span multiple database instances or locations. Partitioning objects based on access patterns or geographical considerations." },
"Object Serialization": { "quote": "Converting objects to a format suitable for storage or transmission. Serializing complex object graphs while preserving their relationships." },
"Triggers": { "quote": "Automatic execution of methods in response to object events. When a Customer.address changes, automatically notify delivery systems." },
"Multi-Value Attributes": { "quote": "Direct support for attributes containing multiple values without normalization. A Person can have multiple phoneNumbers without creating a separate table." },
"Schema-less Design": { "quote": "Supporting objects with varying attributes within the same collection. Customer objects can have different attribute sets based on their type without schema changes." },
"Referential Integrity": { "quote": "Ensuring that relationships between objects remain valid. When an Author is deleted, either prevent deletion if Books reference it or update those references." },
"Object Views": { "quote": "Creating virtual objects derived from existing objects. A CustomerSummary view might combine attributes from Customer, Orders, and Payments." },
"Dynamic Classification": { "quote": "The ability for objects to change their type during their lifetime. A Trial customer becomes a Premium customer while maintaining the same object identity." },
"Embedded Values": { "quote": "Storing simple value objects directly within their containing object. An Address value embedded within a Customer object rather than referenced." },
"Lazy Loading": { "quote": "Deferring the loading of related objects until they are explicitly accessed. Loading Order details only when the application requests them." },
"Object Clustering": { "quote": "Storing related objects physically close to each other for optimization. Storing a Customer and their recent Orders together to improve access performance." },
"Object Locking": { "quote": "Controlling concurrent access to objects to maintain consistency. Preventing simultaneous modifications to the same Customer object by different sessions." },
"Object-Oriented Database Management System": { "quote": "Complete database systems built around the object paradigm. ObjectDB, db4o, and ObjectStore provide native object persistence without relational translation." }
