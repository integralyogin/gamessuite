"Event Queue": { "quote": "A buffer that stores events to be processed in sequence. Game engines process input, physics, and render events in a specific order each frame." },
"Event Broadcasting": { "quote": "Distributing events to multiple listeners without knowing their identity. Minecraft's event bus allows mods to react to game events without modifying core code." },
"Event Listeners": { "quote": "Components that subscribe to specific events and execute code in response. DOM event listeners in web browsers respond to user interactions like clicks and keyboard input." },
"Event Delegation": { "quote": "Handling events at a higher level in the object hierarchy. React's event delegation manages events at the root level rather than individual components." },
"Event Propagation": { "quote": "How events travel through nested objects or components. DOM events can bubble up or capture down through the document object model." },
"Event Throttling": { "quote": "Limiting the frequency of event processing. Mouse move events are often throttled to prevent performance issues in graphics-intensive applications." },
"Event Pooling": { "quote": "Reusing event objects to reduce garbage collection. Unity's event system pools UI events to improve performance during rapid interactions." },
"Custom Events": { "quote": "Developer-defined events specific to application needs. Unreal Engine's delegate system allows creating game-specific events like 'PlayerDamaged' or 'QuestCompleted'." },
"Event Payloads": { "quote": "Data attached to events providing context for handlers. Redux actions include a type and payload that describe what changed and how." },
"Event Priority": { "quote": "Determining the order in which multiple listeners process an event. Android's onTouchEvent method returns boolean values to control event consumption priority." },
"Event Sourcing": { "quote": "Storing a sequence of events rather than current state. Some multiplayer games record input events to recreate gameplay exactly during replays." },
"Event-Driven Architecture": { "quote": "A design paradigm where system behavior is determined by events. JavaScript's asynchronous nature is built around event-driven programming." },
"Event Hooks": { "quote": "Predefined points where custom code can intercept events. WordPress plugin system uses action and filter hooks to modify core behavior." },
"Event Bubbling": { "quote": "Events starting at the target element and flowing upward through ancestors. Browser click events bubble from the clicked element up to the document root." },
"Event Capturing": { "quote": "Events starting at the root and flowing down to the target element. DOM addEventListener's third parameter enables capture phase handling." },
"Event Cancellation": { "quote": "Preventing default behavior or stopping event propagation. preventDefault() stops form submission when validation fails." },
"Global Event Bus": { "quote": "A centralized mediator for system-wide event communication. Vue.js applications often use a global event bus for component communication." },
"Event Handlers": { "quote": "Functions that execute in response to specific events. onClick handlers respond to user interactions in React components." },
"Asynchronous Events": { "quote": "Events processed outside the main execution flow. JavaScript Promise objects resolve or reject asynchronously when operations complete." },
"Event Logging": { "quote": "Recording events for debugging or analytics. Game telemetry systems log player events to analyze behavior patterns." },
"Event Filtering": { "quote": "Selectively processing events based on criteria. RxJS filters allow processing only events that match specific conditions." },
"Event Aggregation": { "quote": "Combining multiple events into meaningful higher-level events. Pattern recognition systems might combine several 'EnemySpotted' events into a single 'UnderAttack' event." },
"Event Replay": { "quote": "Recreating state by reprocessing a sequence of events. CQRS systems can rebuild state by replaying domain events from the beginning." },
"Event Sourcing": { "quote": "Using events as the primary source of truth. Some game engines record all input events to recreate exact gameplay during replays." },
"Event Batching": { "quote": "Grouping multiple events for efficient processing. Graphics APIs batch rendering events to minimize state changes and optimize performance." },
"Event Debouncing": { "quote": "Processing events only after a quiet period. Window resize handlers are often debounced to avoid excessive recalculations." },
"Event Schema": { "quote": "Formal definition of event structure and properties. GraphQL subscriptions define the exact shape of event data that clients will receive." },
"Event Streams": { "quote": "Continuous flows of events that can be observed over time. RxJS Observables represent streams of events that can be transformed and combined." },
"Event Correlation": { "quote": "Identifying relationships between different events. Security systems correlate login attempts, password changes, and access patterns to detect suspicious activity." }
