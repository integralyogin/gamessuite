Canto 1 - 1.1: The Symbol Dawn


Section 1 - 1: Hour before the Gods


01.01_001:001 - It was the hour before the Gods awake.

01.01_001:002 - Across the path of the divine Event / The huge foreboding mind of Night, alone / In her unlit temple of eternity, / Lay stretched immobile upon Silence’ marge.

01.01_001:003 - Almost one felt, opaque, impenetrable, / In the sombre symbol of her eyeless muse / The abysm of the unbodied Infinite; / A fathomless zero occupied the world.

01.01_001:004 - A power of fallen boundless self awake / Between the first and the last Nothingness, / Recalling the tenebrous womb from which it came, / Turned from the insoluble mystery of birth / And the tardy process of mortality / And longed to reach its end in vacant Nought.

01.01_001:005 - As in a dark beginning of all things, / A mute featureless semblance of the Unknown / Repeating for ever the unconscious act, / Prolonging for ever the unseeing will, / Cradled the cosmic drowse of ignorant Force / Whose moved creative slumber kindles the suns / And carries our lives in its somnambulist whirl.

01.01_001:006 - Athwart the vain enormous trance of Space, / Its formless stupor without mind or life, / A shadow spinning through a soulless Void, / Thrown back once more into unthinking dreams, / Earth wheeled abandoned in the hollow gulfs / Forgetful of her spirit and her fate.

01.01_001:007 - The impassive skies were neutral, empty, still.

01.01_001:008 - Then something in the inscrutable darkness stirred; / A nameless movement, an unthought Idea / Insistent, dissatisfied, without an aim, / Something that wished but knew not how to be, / Teased the Inconscient to wake Ignorance. #beginnings

01.01_001:009 - A throe that came and left a quivering trace, / Gave room for an old tired want unfilled, / At peace in its subconscient moonless cave / To raise its head and look for absent light, / Straining closed eyes of vanished memory, / Like one who searches for a bygone self / And only meets the corpse of his desire. #longing

01.01_001:010 - It was as though even in this Nought’s profound, / Even in this ultimate dissolution’s core / There lurked an unremembering entity, / Survivor of a slain and buried past / Condemned to resume the effort and the pang, / Reviving in another frustrate world. #cycle-of-rebith

01.01_001:011 - An unshaped consciousness desired light / And a blank prescience yearned towards distant change.

01.01_001:012 - As if a childlike finger laid on a cheek / Reminded of the endless need in things / The heedless Mother of the universe, / An infant longing clutched the sombre Vast.

01.01_001:013 - Insensibly somewhere a breach began: / A long lone line of hesitating hue / Like a vague smile tempting a desert heart / Troubled the far rim of life’s obscure sleep.

01.01_001:014 - Arrived from the other side of boundlessness / An eye of deity pierced through the dumb deeps; / A scout in a reconnaissance from the sun, / It seemed amid a heavy cosmic rest, / The torpor of a sick and weary world, / To seek for a spirit sole and desolate / Too fallen to recollect forgotten bliss. #divine-sight

01.01_001:015 - Intervening in a mindless universe, / Its message crept through the reluctant hush / Calling the adventure of consciousness and joy / And, conquering Nature’s disillusioned breast, / Compelled renewed consent to see and feel. #divine-intervention

01.01_001:016 - A thought was sown in the unsounded Void, / A sense was born within the darkness’ depths, / A memory quivered in the heart of Time / As if a soul long dead were moved to live: / But the oblivion that succeeds the fall, / Had blotted the crowded tablets of the past, / And all that was destroyed must be rebuilt / And old experience laboured out once more.

01.01_001:017 - All can be done if the god-touch is there. #yoga

01.01_001:018 - A hope stole in that hardly dared to be / Amid the Night’s forlorn indifference.

01.01_001:019 - As if solicited in an alien world / With timid and hazardous instinctive grace, / Orphaned and driven out to seek a home, / An errant marvel with no place to live, / Into a far-off nook of heaven there came / A slow miraculous gesture’s dim appeal.

01.01_001:020 - The persistent thrill of a transfiguring touch / Persuaded the inert black quietude / And beauty and wonder disturbed the fields of God.

01.01_001:021 - A wandering hand of pale enchanted light / That glowed along a fading moment’s brink, / Fixed with gold panel and opalescent hinge / A gate of dreams ajar on mystery’s verge.

01.01_001:022 - One lucent corner windowing hidden things / Forced the world’s blind immensity to sight. #revelation #divine-method

01.01_001:023 - The darkness failed and slipped like a falling cloak / From the reclining body of a god. ## 

01.01_001:024 - Then through the pallid rift that seemed at first / Hardly enough for a trickle from the suns, / Outpoured the revelation and the flame.

01.01_001:025 - The brief perpetual sign recurred above.

01.01_001:026 - A glamour from the unreached transcendences / Iridescent with the glory of the Unseen, / A message from the unknown immortal Light / Ablaze upon creation’s quivering edge, / Dawn built her aura of magnificent hues / And buried its seed of grandeur in the hours. #divine-beauty #divine-message

01.01_001:027 - An instant’s visitor the godhead shone: / On life’s thin border awhile the Vision stood / And bent over earth’s pondering forehead curve.

01.01_001:028 - Interpreting a recondite beauty and bliss / In colour’s hieroglyphs of mystic sense, / It wrote the lines of a significant myth / Telling of a greatness of spiritual dawns, / A brilliant code penned with the sky for page.

01.01_001:029 - Almost that day the epiphany was disclosed / Of which our thoughts and hopes are signal flares; / A lonely splendour from the invisible goal / Almost was flung on the opaque Inane.

01.01_001:030 - Once more a tread perturbed the vacant Vasts; / Infinity’s centre, a Face of rapturous calm / Parted the eternal lids that open heaven; / A Form from far beatitudes seemed to near.

01.01_001:031 - Ambassadress twixt eternity and change, / The omniscient Goddess leaned across the breadths / That wrap the fated journeyings of the stars / And saw the spaces ready for her feet. #goddess

01.01_001:032 - Once she half looked behind for her veiled sun, / Then, thoughtful, went to her immortal work.

01.01_001:033t - Earth felt the Imperishable’s passage close: / The waking ear of Nature heard her steps / And wideness turned to her its limitless eye, / And, scattered on sealed depths, her luminous smile / Kindled to fire the silence of the worlds. #assent, divine-beauty, divine-effect, #divine-grace, divine-means, divine-method, glory

01.01_001:034 - All grew a consecration and a rite. #divine-effect #divine-result

01.01_001:035 - Air was a vibrant link between earth and heaven; / The wide-winged hymn of a great priestly wind / Arose and failed upon the altar hills; / The high boughs prayed in a revealing sky. #divine-beauty #divine-effect

01.01_001:036 - Here where our half-lit ignorance skirts the gulfs / On the dumb bosom of the ambiguous earth, / Here where one knows not even the step in front / And Truth has her throne on the shadowy back of doubt, / On this anguished and precarious field of toil / Outspread beneath some large indifferent gaze, / Impartial witness to our joy and bale, / Our prostrate soil bore the awakening ray. #spiritual-instruction

01.01_001:037 - Here too the vision and prophetic gleam / Lit into miracles common meaningless shapes; / Then the divine afflatus, spent, withdrew, / Unwanted, fading from the mortal’s range. #divine-sight #divine-action #vision

01.01_001:038 - A sacred yearning lingered in its trace, / The worship of a Presence and a Power / Too perfect to be held by death-bound hearts, / The prescience of a marvellous birth to come. #divine-effect

01.01_001:039 - Only a little the God-light can stay: / Spiritual beauty illumining human sight / Lines with its passion and mystery Matter’s mask / And squanders eternity on a beat of Time.

01.01_001:040 - As when a soul draws near the sill of birth, / Adjoining mortal time to Timelessness, / A spark of deity lost in Matter’s crypt / Its lustre vanishes in the inconscient planes, / That transitory glow of magic fire / So now dissolved in bright accustomed air. #divine-process #soul #rebirth

01.01_001:041 - The message ceased and waned the messenger.

01.01_001:042 - The single Call, the uncompanioned Power, / Drew back into some far-off secret world / The hue and marvel of the supernal beam: / She looked no more on our mortality.

01.01_001:043 - The excess of beauty natural to God-kind / Could not uphold its claim on time-born eyes; / Too mystic-real for space-tenancy / Her body of glory was expunged from heaven: / The rarity and wonder lived no more.

01.01_001:044 - There was the common light of earthly day.

01.01_001:045 - Affranchised from the respite of fatigue / Once more the rumour of the speed of Life / Pursued the cycles of her blinded quest.

01.01_001:046 - All sprang to their unvarying daily acts; / The thousand peoples of the soil and tree / Obeyed the unforeseeing instant’s urge, / And, leader here with his uncertain mind, / Alone who stares at the future’s covered face, / Man lifted up the burden of his fate.


Section 2 - 2: pure divine intolerance




01.01_002:001 - And Savitri too awoke among these tribes / That hastened to join the brilliant Summoner’s chant / And, lured by the beauty of the apparent ways, / Acclaimed their portion of ephemeral joy.

01.01_002:002 - Akin to the eternity whence she came, / No part she took in this small happiness; / A mighty stranger in the human field, / The embodied Guest within made no response.

01.01_002:003 - The call that wakes the leap of human mind, / Its chequered eager motion of pursuit, / Its fluttering-hued illusion of desire, / Visited her heart like a sweet alien note.

01.01_002:004 - Time’s message of brief light was not for her.

01.01_002:005 - In her there was the anguish of the gods / Imprisoned in our transient human mould, / The deathless conquered by the death of things.

01.01_002:006 - A vaster Nature’s joy had once been hers, / But long could keep not its gold heavenly hue / Or stand upon this brittle earthly base.

01.01_002:007 - A narrow movement on Time’s deep abysm, / Life’s fragile littleness denied the power, / The proud and conscious wideness and the bliss / She had brought with her into the human form, / The calm delight that weds one soul to all, / The key to the flaming doors of ecstasy.

01.01_002:008 - Earth’s grain that needs the sap of pleasure and tears / Rejected the undying rapture’s boon: / Offered to the daughter of infinity / Her passion-flower of love and doom she gave.

01.01_002:009 - In vain now seemed the splendid sacrifice.

01.01_002:010 - A prodigal of her rich divinity, / Her self and all she was she had lent to men, / Hoping her greater being to implant / That heaven might native grow on mortal soil.

01.01_002:011 - Hard is it to persuade earth-nature’s change; / Mortality bears ill the eternal’s touch: / It fears the pure divine intolerance / Of that assault of ether and of fire; / It murmurs at its sorrowless happiness, / Almost with hate repels the light it brings; / It trembles at its naked power of Truth / And the might and sweetness of its absolute Voice.

01.01_002:012t - Inflicting on the heights the abysm’s law, / It sullies with its mire heaven’s messengers: / Its thorns of fallen nature are the defence / It turns against the saviour hands of Grace; / It meets the sons of God with death and pain. #human-reactions #human-response-to-divine #response-to-light

01.01_002:013 - A glory of lightnings traversing the earth-scene, / Their sun-thoughts fading, darkened by ignorant minds, / Their work betrayed, their good to evil turned, / The cross their payment for the crown they gave, / Only they leave behind a splendid Name.

01.01_002:014 - A fire has come and touched men’s hearts and gone; / A few have caught flame and risen to greater life.

01.01_002:015 - Too unlike the world she came to help and save, / Her greatness weighed upon its ignorant breast, / And from its deep chasms welled a dire return, / A portion of its sorrow, struggle, fall.

01.01_002:016 - To live with grief, to confront death on her road,— / The mortal’s lot became the Immortal’s share.

01.01_002:017 - Thus trapped in the gin of earthly destinies, / Awaiting her ordeal’s hour abode, / Outcast from her inborn felicity, / Accepting life’s obscure terrestrial robe, / Hiding herself even from those she loved, / The godhead greater by a human fate.

01.01_002:018 - A dark foreknowledge separated her / From all of whom she was the star and stay; / Too great to impart the peril and the pain, / In her torn depths she kept the grief to come.

01.01_002:019 - As one who watching over men left blind / Takes up the load of an unwitting race, / Harbouring a foe whom with her heart she must feed, / Unknown her act, unknown the doom she faced, / Unhelped she must foresee and dread and dare.

01.01_002:020 - The long-foreknown and fatal morn was here / Bringing a noon that seemed like every noon.

01.01_002:021 - For Nature walks upon her mighty way / Unheeding when she breaks a soul, a life; / Leaving her slain behind she travels on: / Man only marks and God’s all-seeing eyes.

01.01_002:022 - Even in this moment of her soul’s despair, / In its grim rendezvous with death and fear, / No cry broke from her lips, no call for aid; / She told the secret of her woe to none: / Calm was her face and courage kept her mute.

01.01_002:023 - Yet only her outward self suffered and strove; / Even her humanity was half divine: / Her spirit opened to the Spirit in all, / Her nature felt all Nature as its own.

01.01_002:024 - Apart, living within, all lives she bore; / Aloof, she carried in herself the world: / Her dread was one with the great cosmic dread, / Her strength was founded on the cosmic mights; / The universal Mother’s love was hers.

01.01_002:025 - Against the evil at life’s afflicted roots, / Her own calamity its private sign, / Of her pangs she made a mystic poignant sword.

01.01_002:026 - A solitary mind, a world-wide heart, / To the lone Immortal’s unshared work she rose.

01.01_002:027 - At first life grieved not in her burdened breast: / On the lap of earth’s original somnolence / Inert, released into forgetfulness / Prone it reposed, unconscious on mind’s verge, / Obtuse and tranquil like the stone and star.

01.01_002:028 - In a deep cleft of silence twixt two realms / She lay remote from grief, unsawn by care, / Nothing recalling of the sorrow here.

01.01_002:029 - Then a slow faint remembrance shadowlike moved, / And sighing she laid her hand upon her bosom / And recognised the close and lingering ache, / Deep, quiet, old, made natural to its place, / But knew not why it was there nor whence it came.

01.01_002:030 - The Power that kindles mind was still withdrawn: / Heavy, unwilling were life’s servitors / Like workers with no wages of delight; / Sullen, the torch of sense refused to burn; / The unassisted brain found not its past.

01.01_002:031 - Only a vague earth-nature held the frame.

01.01_002:032 - But now she stirred, her life shared the cosmic load.

01.01_002:033 - At the summons of her body’s voiceless call / Her strong far-winging spirit travelled back, / Back to the yoke of ignorance and fate, / Back to the labour and stress of mortal days, / Lighting a pathway through strange symbol dreams / Across the ebbing of the seas of sleep.

01.01_002:034 - Her house of Nature felt an unseen sway, / Illumined swiftly were life’s darkened rooms, / And memory’s casements opened on the hours / And the tired feet of thought approached her doors.

01.01_002:035 - All came back to her: Earth and Love and Doom, / The ancient disputants, encircled her / Like giant figures wrestling in the night: / The godheads from the dim Inconscient born / Awoke to struggle and the pang divine, / And in the shadow of her flaming heart, / At the sombre centre of the dire debate, / A guardian of the unconsoled abyss / Inheriting the long agony of the globe, / A stone-still figure of high and godlike Pain / Stared into space with fixed regardless eyes / That saw grief’s timeless depths but not life’s goal.

01.01_002:036 - Afflicted by his harsh divinity, / Bound to his throne, he waited unappeased / The daily oblation of her unwept tears.

01.01_002:037 - All the fierce question of man’s hours relived.

01.01_002:038 - The sacrifice of suffering and desire / Earth offers to the immortal Ecstasy / Began again beneath the eternal Hand.

01.01_002:039 - Awake she endured the moments’ serried march / And looked on this green smiling dangerous world, / And heard the ignorant cry of living things.

01.01_002:040 - Amid the trivial sounds, the unchanging scene / Her soul arose confronting Time and Fate.

01.01_002:041 - Immobile in herself, she gathered force.

01.01_002:042 - This was the day when Satyavan must die.


Canto 2 - 1.2: The Issue


Section I - 3: her look, her smile


01.02_003:001 - Awhile, withdrawn in secret fields of thought, / Her mind moved in a many-imaged past / That lived again and saw its end approach: / Dying, it lived imperishably in her; / Transient and vanishing from transient eyes, / Invisible, a fateful ghost of self, / It bore the future on its phantom breast.

01.02_003:002 - Along the fleeting event’s far-backward trail / Regressed the stream of the insistent hours, / And on the bank of the mysterious flood / Peopled with well-loved forms now seen no more / And the subtle images of things that were, / Her witness spirit stood reviewing Time.

01.02_003:003 - All that she once had hoped and dreamed and been, / Flew past her eagle-winged through memory’s skies.

01.02_003:004 - As in a many-hued flaming inner dawn, / Her life’s broad highways and its sweet bypaths / Lay mapped to her sun-clear recording view, / From the bright country of her childhood’s days / And the blue mountains of her soaring youth / And the paradise groves and peacock wings of Love / To joy clutched under the silent shadow of doom / In a last turn where heaven raced with hell.

01.02_003:005 - Twelve passionate months led in a day of fate.

01.02_003:006 - An absolute supernatural darkness falls / On man sometimes when he draws near to God: / An hour comes when fail all Nature’s means; / Forced out from the protecting Ignorance / And flung back on his naked primal need, / He at length must cast from him his surface soul / And be the ungarbed entity within: / That hour had fallen now on Savitri.

01.02_003:007 - A point she had reached where life must be in vain / Or, in her unborn element awake, / Her will must cancel her body’s destiny.

01.02_003:008 - For only the unborn spirit’s timeless power / Can lift the yoke imposed by birth in time.

01.02_003:009 - Only the Self that builds this figure of self / Can rase the fixed interminable line / That joins these changing names, these numberless lives, / These new oblivious personalities / And keeps still lurking in our conscious acts / The trail of old forgotten thoughts and deeds, / Disown the legacy of our buried selves, / The burdensome heirship to our vanished forms / Accepted blindly by the body and soul.

01.02_003:010 - An episode in an unremembered tale, / Its beginning lost, its motive and plot concealed, / A once living story has prepared and made / Our present fate, child of past energies.

01.02_003:011t - The fixity of the cosmic sequences / Fastened with hidden inevitable links / She must disrupt, dislodge by her soul’s force / Her past, a block on the immortal’s road, / Make a rased ground and shape anew her fate. #destiny #fate #karma #liberation #past-obstacles #potential #souls-force

01.02_003:012 - A colloquy of the original Gods / Meeting upon the borders of the unknown, / Her soul’s debate with embodied Nothingness / Must be wrestled out on a dangerous dim background: / Her being must confront its formless Cause, / Against the universe weigh its single self.

01.02_003:013 - On the bare peak where Self is alone with Nought / And life has no sense and love no place to stand, / She must plead her case upon extinction’s verge, / In the world’s death-cave uphold life’s helpless claim / And vindicate her right to be and love.

01.02_003:014 - Altered must be Nature’s harsh economy; / Acquittance she must win from her past’s bond, / An old account of suffering exhaust, / Strike out from Time the soul’s long compound debt / And the heavy servitudes of the Karmic Gods, / The slow revenge of unforgiving Law / And the deep need of universal pain / And hard sacrifice and tragic consequence.

01.02_003:015 - Out of a timeless barrier she must break, / Penetrate with her thinking depths the Void’s monstrous hush, / Look into the lonely eyes of immortal Death / And with her nude spirit measure the Infinite’s night.

01.02_003:016 - The great and dolorous moment now was close.

01.02_003:017 - A mailed battalion marching to its doom, / The last long days went by with heavy tramp, / Long but too soon to pass, too near the end.

01.02_003:018 - Alone amid the many faces loved, / Aware among unknowing happy hearts, / Her armoured spirit kept watch upon the hours / Listening for a foreseen tremendous step / In the closed beauty of the inhuman wilds.

01.02_003:019 - A combatant in silent dreadful lists, / The world unknowing, for the world she stood: / No helper had she save the Strength within; / There was no witness of terrestrial eyes; / The Gods above and Nature’s soul below / Were the spectators of that mighty strife.

01.02_003:020 - Around her were the austere sky-pointing hills, / And the green murmurous broad deep-thoughted woods / Muttered incessantly their muffled spell.

01.02_003:021 - A dense magnificent coloured self-wrapped life / Draped in the leaves’ vivid emerald monotone / And set with chequered sunbeams and blithe flowers / Immured her destiny’s secluded scene.

01.02_003:022 - There had she grown to the stature of her spirit: / The genius of titanic silences / Steeping her soul in its wide loneliness / Had shown to her her self’s bare reality / And mated her with her environment.

01.02_003:023 - Its solitude greatened her human hours / With a background of the eternal and unique.

01.02_003:024t - A force of spare direct necessity / Reduced the heavy framework of man’s days / And his overburdening mass of outward needs / To a first thin strip of simple animal wants, / And the mighty wideness of the primitive earth / And the brooding multitude of patient trees / And the musing sapphire leisure of the sky / And the solemn weight of the slowly passing months / Had left in her deep room for thought and God. #desire #divine-formula #god #liberation #making-space #method #need #yoga

01.02_003:025 - There was her drama’s radiant prologue lived.

01.02_003:026 - A spot for the eternal’s tread on earth / Set in the cloistral yearning of the woods / And watched by the aspiration of the peaks / Appeared through an aureate opening in Time / Where stillness listening felt the unspoken word / And the hours forgot to pass towards grief and change.

01.02_003:027 - Here with the suddenness divine advents have, / Repeating the marvel of the first descent, / Changing to rapture the dull earthly round, / Love came to her hiding the shadow, Death.

01.02_003:028 - Well might he find in her his perfect shrine.

01.02_003:029 - Since first the earth-being’s heavenward growth began, / Through all the long ordeal of the race, / Never a rarer creature bore his shaft, / That burning test of the godhead in our parts, / A lightning from the heights on our abyss.

01.02_003:030 - All in her pointed to a nobler kind.

01.02_003:031 - Near to earth’s wideness, intimate with heaven, / Exalted and swift her young large-visioned spirit / Voyaging through worlds of splendour and of calm / Overflew the ways of Thought to unborn things.

01.02_003:032 - Ardent was her self-poised unstumbling will; / Her mind, a sea of white sincerity, / Passionate in flow, had not one turbid wave.

01.02_003:033 - As in a mystic and dynamic dance / A priestess of immaculate ecstasies / Inspired and ruled from Truth’s revealing vault / Moves in some prophet cavern of the gods, / A heart of silence in the hands of joy / Inhabited with rich creative beats / A body like a parable of dawn / That seemed a niche for veiled divinity / Or golden temple door to things beyond.

01.02_003:034t - Immortal rhythms swayed in her time-born steps; / Her look, her smile awoke celestial sense / Even in earth-stuff, and their intense delight / Poured a supernal beauty on men’s lives. #awakening #divine-beauty #divine-effect #divine-influence #divine-mother #savitri #she #transformation

01.02_003:035 - A wide self-giving was her native act; / A magnanimity as of sea or sky / Enveloped with its greatness all that came / And gave a sense as of a greatened world: / Her kindly care was a sweet temperate sun, / Her high passion a blue heaven’s equipoise.

01.02_003:036 - As might a soul fly like a hunted bird, / Escaping with tired wings from a world of storms, / And a quiet reach like a remembered breast, / In a haven of safety and splendid soft repose / One could drink life back in streams of honey-fire, / Recover the lost habit of happiness, / Feel her bright nature’s glorious ambiance, / And preen joy in her warmth and colour’s rule.

01.02_003:037 - A deep of compassion, a hushed sanctuary, / Her inward help unbarred a gate in heaven; / Love in her was wider than the universe, / The whole world could take refuge in her single heart.

01.02_003:038 - The great unsatisfied godhead here could dwell: / Vacant of the dwarf self’s imprisoned air / Her mood could harbour his sublimer breath / Spiritual that can make all things divine.

01.02_003:039 - For even her gulfs were secrecies of light.

01.02_003:040 - At once she was the stillness and the word, / A continent of self-diffusing peace, / An ocean of untrembling virgin fire: / The strength, the silence of the gods were hers.

01.02_003:041 - In her he found a vastness like his own, / His high warm subtle ether he refound / And moved in her as in his natural home.

01.02_003:042 - In her he met his own eternity.



Section I - 4: a prayer, a master act


01.02_004:001 - Till then no mournful line had barred this ray.

01.02_004:002 - On the frail breast of this precarious earth, / Since her orbed sight in its breath-fastened house, / Opening in sympathy with happier stars / Where life is not exposed to sorrowful change, / Remembered beauty death-claimed lids ignore / And wondered at this world of fragile forms / Carried on canvas-strips of shimmering Time, / The impunity of unborn Mights was hers.

01.02_004:003 - Although she leaned to bear the human load, / Her walk kept still the measure of the gods.

01.02_004:004 - Earth’s breath had failed to stain that brilliant glass: / Unsmeared with the dust of our mortal atmosphere / It still reflected heaven’s spiritual joy.

01.02_004:005 - Almost they saw who lived within her light / Her playmate in the sempiternal spheres / Descended from its unattainable realms / In her attracting advent’s luminous wake, / The white-fire dragon bird of endless bliss / Drifting with burning wings above her days: / Heaven’s tranquil shield guarded the missioned child.

01.02_004:006 - A glowing orbit was her early term, / Years like gold raiment of the gods that pass; / Her youth sat throned in calm felicity.

01.02_004:007 - But joy cannot endure until the end: / There is a darkness in terrestrial things / That will not suffer long too glad a note.

01.02_004:008 - On her too closed the inescapable Hand: / The armed Immortal bore the snare of Time.

01.02_004:009 - One dealt with her who meets the burdened great.

01.02_004:010t - Assigner of the ordeal and the path / Who chooses in this holocaust of the soul / Death, fall and sorrow as the spirit’s goads, / The dubious godhead with his torch of pain / Lit up the chasm of the unfinished world / And called her to fill with her vast self the abyss. #divine-meaning #divine-request #divine-working #involution #meaning-of-difficulty

01.02_004:011 - August and pitiless in his calm outlook, / Heightening the Eternal’s dreadful strategy, / He measured the difficulty with the might / And dug more deep the gulf that all must cross.

01.02_004:012 - Assailing her divinest elements, / He made her heart kin to the striving human heart / And forced her strength to its appointed road.

01.02_004:013 - For this she had accepted mortal breath; / To wrestle with the Shadow she had come / And must confront the riddle of man’s birth / And life’s brief struggle in dumb Matter’s night.

01.02_004:014 - Whether to bear with Ignorance and Death / Or hew the ways of Immortality, / To win or lose the godlike game for man, / Was her soul’s issue thrown with Destiny’s dice.

01.02_004:015 - But not to submit and suffer was she born; / To lead, to deliver was her glorious part.

01.02_004:016 - Here was no fabric of terrestrial make / Fit for a day’s use by busy careless Powers.

01.02_004:017 - An image fluttering on the screen of fate / Half-animated for a passing show, / Or a castaway on the ocean of Desire / Flung to the eddies in a ruthless sport / And tossed along the gulfs of Circumstance, / A creature born to bend beneath the yoke, / A chattel and a plaything of Time’s lords, / Or one more pawn who comes destined to be pushed / One slow move forward on a measureless board / In the chess-play of the earth-soul with Doom,— / Such is the human figure drawn by Time.

01.02_004:018 - A conscious frame was here, a self-born Force.

01.02_004:019 - In this enigma of the dusk of God, / This slow and strange uneasy compromise / Of limiting Nature with a limitless Soul, / Where all must move between an ordered Chance / And an uncaring blind Necessity, / Too high the fire spiritual dare not blaze.

01.02_004:020 - If once it met the intense original Flame, / An answering touch might shatter all measures made / And earth sink down with the weight of the Infinite.

01.02_004:021 - A gaol is this immense material world.

01.02_004:022 - Across each road stands armed a stone-eyed law, / At every gate the huge dim sentinels pace.

01.02_004:023 - A grey tribunal of the Ignorance, / An Inquisition of the priests of Night / In judgment sit on the adventurer soul, / And the dual tables and the Karmic norm / Restrain the Titan in us and the God: / Pain with its lash, joy with its silver bribe / Guard the Wheel’s circling immobility, / A bond is put on the high climbing mind, / A seal on the too large wide-open heart; / Death stays the journeying discoverer, Life.

01.02_004:024 - Thus is the throne of the Inconscient safe / While the tardy coilings of the aeons pass / And the Animal browses in the sacred fence / And the gold Hawk can cross the skies no more.

01.02_004:025 - But one stood up and lit the limitless flame.

01.02_004:026 - Arraigned by the dark Power that hates all bliss / In the dire court where life must pay for joy, / Sentenced by the mechanic justicer / To the afflicting penalty of man’s hopes, / Her head she bowed not to the stark decree / Baring her helpless heart to destiny’s stroke.

01.02_004:027 - So bows and must the mind-born will in man / Obedient to the statutes fixed of old, / Admitting without appeal the nether gods.

01.02_004:028 - In her the superhuman cast its seed.

01.02_004:029 - Inapt to fold its mighty wings of dream / Her spirit refused to hug the common soil, / Or, finding all life’s golden meanings robbed, / Compound with earth, struck from the starry list, / Or quench with black despair the God-given light.

01.02_004:030 - Accustomed to the eternal and the true, / Her being conscious of its divine founts / Asked not from mortal frailty pain’s relief, / Patched not with failure bargain or compromise.

01.02_004:031 - A work she had to do, a word to speak; / Writing the unfinished story of her soul / In thoughts and actions graved in Nature’s book, / She accepted not to close the luminous page, / Cancel her commerce with eternity, / Or set a signature of weak assent / To the brute balance of the world’s exchange.

01.02_004:032 - A force in her that toiled since earth was made, / Accomplishing in life the great world-plan, / Pursuing after death immortal aims, / Repugned to admit frustration’s barren role, / Forfeit the meaning of her birth in Time, / Obey the government of the casual fact / Or yield her high destiny up to passing Chance.

01.02_004:033 - In her own self she found her high recourse; / She matched with the iron law her sovereign right: / Her single will opposed the cosmic rule.

01.02_004:034 - To stay the wheels of Doom this greatness rose.

01.02_004:035 - At the Unseen’s knock upon the hidden gates / Her strength made greater by the lightning’s touch / Awoke from slumber in her heart’s recess.

01.02_004:036 - It bore the stroke of That which kills and saves.

01.02_004:037 - Across the awful march no eye can see, / Barring its dreadful route no will can change, / She faced the engines of the universe; / A heart stood in the way of the driving wheels: / Its giant workings paused in front of a mind, / Its stark conventions met the flame of a soul.

01.02_004:038At - A magic leverage suddenly is caught / That moves the veiled Ineffable’s timeless will: / A prayer, a master act, a king idea / Can link man’s strength to a transcendent Force. #divine-action #divine-method #divine-potential #magic-leverage #miracles #power-of-action #power-of-ideas #power-of-prayer #yoga

01.02_004:039A - Then miracle is made the common rule, / One mighty deed can change the course of things; / A lonely thought becomes omnipotent.

01.02_004:040 - All now seems Nature’s massed machinery; / An endless servitude to material rule / And long determination’s rigid chain, / Her firm and changeless habits aping Law, / Her empire of unconscious deft device / Annul the claim of man’s free human will.

01.02_004:041 - He too is a machine amid machines; / A piston brain pumps out the shapes of thought, / A beating heart cuts out emotion’s modes; / An insentient energy fabricates a soul.

01.02_004:042 - Or the figure of the world reveals the signs / Of a tied Chance repeating her old steps / In circles around Matter’s binding-posts.

01.02_004:043 - A random series of inept events / To which reason lends illusive sense, is here, / Or the empiric Life’s instinctive search, / Or a vast ignorant mind’s colossal work.

01.02_004:044 - But wisdom comes, and vision grows within; / Then Nature’s instrument crowns himself her king; / He feels his witnessing self and conscious power; / His soul steps back and sees the Light supreme.

01.02_004:045 - A Godhead stands behind the brute machine.

01.02_004:046 - This truth broke in in a triumph of fire; / A victory was won for God in man, / The deity revealed its hidden face.

01.02_004:047 - The great World-Mother now in her arose: / A living choice reversed fate’s cold dead turn, / Affirmed the spirit’s tread on Circumstance, / Pressed back the senseless dire revolving Wheel / And stopped the mute march of Necessity.

01.02_004:048 - A flaming warrior from the eternal peaks / Empowered to force the door denied and closed / Smote from Death’s visage its dumb absolute / And burst the bounds of consciousness and Time.


Canto 3 - 1.3: The Yoga of The King: The Yoga of the Souls Release



Section I - 5: build of the Immortal


01.03_005:001 - A world’s desire compelled her mortal birth.

01.03_005:002 - One in the front of the immemorial quest, / Protagonist of the mysterious play / In which the Unknown pursues himself through forms / And limits his eternity by the hours / And the blind Void struggles to live and see, / A thinker and toiler in the ideal’s air, / Brought down to earth’s dumb need her radiant power.

01.03_005:003 - His was a spirit that stooped from larger spheres / Into our province of ephemeral sight, / A colonist from immortality.

01.03_005:004 - A pointing beam on earth’s uncertain roads, / His birth held up a symbol and a sign; / His human self like a translucent cloak / Covered the All-Wise who leads the unseeing world.

01.03_005:005 - Affiliated to cosmic Space and Time / And paying here God’s debt to earth and man / A greater sonship was his divine right.

01.03_005:006 - Although consenting to mortal ignorance, / His knowledge shared the Light ineffable.

01.03_005:007 - A strength of the original Permanence / Entangled in the moment and its flow, / He kept the vision of the Vasts behind: / A power was in him from the Unknowable.

01.03_005:008 - An archivist of the symbols of the Beyond, / A treasurer of superhuman dreams, / He bore the stamp of mighty memories / And shed their grandiose ray on human life.

01.03_005:009 - His days were a long growth to the Supreme.

01.03_005:010 - A skyward being nourishing its roots / On sustenance from occult spiritual founts / Climbed through white rays to meet an unseen Sun.

01.03_005:011 - His soul lived as eternity’s delegate, / His mind was like a fire assailing heaven, / His will a hunter in the trails of light.

01.03_005:012 - An ocean impulse lifted every breath; / Each action left the footprints of a God, / Each moment was a beat of puissant wings.

01.03_005:013 - The little plot of our mortality / Touched by this tenant from the heights became / A playground of the living Infinite.

01.03_005:014 - This bodily appearance is not all; / The form deceives, the person is a mask; / Hid deep in man celestial powers can dwell.

01.03_005:015 - His fragile ship conveys through the sea of years / An incognito of the Imperishable.

01.03_005:016 - A spirit that is a flame of God abides, / A fiery portion of the Wonderful, / Artist of his own beauty and delight, / Immortal in our mortal poverty.

01.03_005:017 - This sculptor of the forms of the Infinite, / This screened unrecognised Inhabitant, / Initiate of his own veiled mysteries, / Hides in a small dumb seed his cosmic thought.

01.03_005:018 - In the mute strength of the occult Idea / Determining predestined shape and act, / Passenger from life to life, from scale to scale, / Changing his imaged self from form to form, / He regards the icon growing by his gaze / And in the worm foresees the coming god.

01.03_005:019 - At last the traveller in the paths of Time / Arrives on the frontiers of eternity.

01.03_005:020 - In the transient symbol of humanity draped, / He feels his substance of undying self / And loses his kinship to mortality.

01.03_005:021 - A beam of the Eternal smites his heart, / His thought stretches into infinitude: / All in him turns to spirit vastnesses.

01.03_005:022 - His soul breaks out to join the Oversoul, / His life is oceaned by that superlife.

01.03_005:023 - He has drunk from the breasts of the Mother of the worlds; / A topless supernature fills his frame: / She adopts his spirit’s everlasting ground / As the security of her changing world / And shapes the figure of her unborn mights.

01.03_005:024 - Immortally she conceives herself in him, / In the creature the unveiled creatrix works: / Her face is seen through his face, her eyes through his eyes; / Her being is his through a vast identity.

01.03_005:025 - Then is revealed in man the overt Divine.

01.03_005:026 - A static Oneness and dynamic Power / Descend in him, the integral Godhead’s seals; / His soul and body take that splendid stamp.

01.03_005:027 - A long dim preparation is man’s life, / A circle of toil and hope and war and peace / Tracked out by Life on Matter’s obscure ground / In his climb to a peak no feet have ever trod, / He seeks through a penumbra shot with flame / A veiled reality half-known, ever missed, / A search for something or someone never found, / Cult of an ideal never made real here, / An endless spiral of ascent and fall / Until at last is reached the giant point / Through which his Glory shines for whom we were made / And we break into the infinity of God.

01.03_005:028 - Across our nature’s border line we escape / Into supernature’s arc of living light.

01.03_005:029 - This now was witnessed in that son of Force, / In him that high transition laid its base.

01.03_005:030 - Original and supernal Immanence / Of which all Nature’s process is the art, / The cosmic Worker set his secret hand / To turn this frail mud-engine to heaven-use.

01.03_005:031 - A Presence wrought behind the ambiguous screen: / It beat his soil to bear a Titan’s weight, / Refining half-hewn blocks of natural strength / It built his soul into a statued God.

01.03_005:032 - The Craftsman of the magic stuff of self / Who labours at his high and difficult plan / In the wide workshop of the wonderful world, / Modelled in inward Time his rhythmic parts.

01.03_005:033 - Then came the abrupt transcendent miracle: / The masked immaculate Grandeur could outline, / At travail in the occult womb of life, / His dreamed magnificence of things to be.

01.03_005:034 - A crown of the architecture of the worlds, / A mystery of married Earth and Heaven / Annexed divinity to the mortal scheme.

01.03_005:035 - A Seer was born, a shining Guest of Time.

01.03_005:036 - For him mind’s limiting firmament ceased above, / In the griffin forefront of the Night and Day / A gap was rent in the all-concealing vault; / The conscious ends of being went rolling back: / The landmarks of the little person fell, / The island ego joined its continent: / Overpassed was this world of rigid limiting forms: / Life’s barriers opened into the Unknown.

01.03_005:037 - Abolished were conception’s covenants / And, striking off subjection’s rigorous clause / Annulled the soul’s treaty with Nature’s nescience.

01.03_005:038 - All the grey inhibitions were torn off / And broken the intellect’s hard and lustrous lid; / Truth unpartitioned found immense sky-room; / An empyrean vision saw and knew; / The bounded mind became a boundless light, / The finite self mated with Infinity.

01.03_005:039 - His march now soared into an eagle’s flight.

01.03_005:040 - Out of apprenticeship to Ignorance / Wisdom upraised him to her master craft / And made him an arch-mason of the soul, / A builder of the Immortal’s secret house, / An aspirant to supernal Timelessness: / Freedom and empire called to him from on high; / Above mind’s twilight and life’s star-led night / There gleamed the dawn of a spiritual day.



Section I - 6: countries of the unborn


01.03_006:001 - As so he grew into his larger self, / Humanity framed his movements less and less, / A greater being saw a greater world.

01.03_006:002 - A fearless will for knowledge dared to erase / The lines of safety reason draws that bar / Mind’s soar, soul’s dive into the Infinite.

01.03_006:003 - Even his first steps broke our small earth-bounds / And loitered in a vaster freer air.

01.03_006:004 - In hands sustained by a transfiguring Might / He caught up lightly like a giant’s bow / Left slumbering in a sealed and secret cave / The powers that sleep unused in man within.

01.03_006:005 - He made of miracle a normal act / And, turned to a common part of divine works, / Magnificently natural at this height / Efforts that would shatter the strength of mortal hearts, / Pursued in a royalty of mighty ease / Aims too sublime for Nature’s daily will: / The gifts of the spirit crowding came to him; / They were his life’s pattern and his privilege.

01.03_006:006 - A pure perception lent its lucent joy: / Its intimate vision waited not to think; / It enveloped all Nature in a single glance, / It looked into the very self of things; / Deceived no more by form he saw the soul.

01.03_006:007 - In beings it knew what lurked to them unknown; / It seized the idea in mind, the wish in the heart; / It plucked out from grey folds of secrecy / The motives which from their own sight men hide.

01.03_006:008 - He felt the beating life in other men / Invade him with their happiness and their grief; / Their love, their anger, their unspoken hopes / Entered in currents or in pouring waves / Into the immobile ocean of his calm.

01.03_006:009 - He heard the inspired sound of his own thoughts / Re-echoed in the vault of other minds; / The world’s thought-streams travelled into his ken; / His inner self grew near to others’ selves / And bore a kinship’s weight, a common tie, / Yet stood untouched, king of itself, alone.

01.03_006:010 - A magical accord quickened and attuned / To ethereal symphonies the old earthy strings; / It raised the servitors of mind and life / To be happy partners in the soul’s response, / Tissue and nerve were turned to sensitive chords, / Records of lustre and ecstasy; it made / The body’s means the spirit’s acolytes.

01.03_006:011 - A heavenlier function with a finer mode / Lit with its grace man’s outward earthliness; / The soul’s experience of its deeper sheaths / No more slept drugged by Matter’s dominance.

01.03_006:012 - In the dead wall closing us from wider self, / Into a secrecy of apparent sleep, / The mystic tract beyond our waking thoughts, / A door parted, built in by Matter’s force, / Releasing things unseized by earthly sense: / A world unseen, unknown by outward mind / Appeared in the silent spaces of the soul.

01.03_006:013 - He sat in secret chambers looking out / Into the luminous countries of the unborn / Where all things dreamed by the mind are seen and true / And all that the life longs for is drawn close.

01.03_006:014 - He saw the Perfect in their starry homes / Wearing the glory of a deathless form / Lain in the arms of the Eternal’s peace, / Rapt in the heart-beats of God-ecstasy.

01.03_006:015 - He lived in the mystic space where thought is born / And will is nursed by an ethereal Power / And fed on the white milk of the Eternal’s strengths / Till it grows into the likeness of a god.

01.03_006:016 - In the Witness’s occult rooms with mind-built walls / On hidden interiors, lurking passages / Opened the windows of the inner sight.

01.03_006:017 - He owned the house of undivided Time.

01.03_006:018 - Lifting the heavy curtain of the flesh / He stood upon a threshold serpent-watched, / And peered into gleaming endless corridors, / Silent and listening in the silent heart / For the coming of the new and the unknown.

01.03_006:019 - He gazed across the empty stillnesses / And heard the footsteps of the undreamed Idea / In the far avenues of the Beyond.

01.03_006:020 - He heard the secret Voice, the Word that knows, / And saw the secret face that is our own.

01.03_006:021 - The inner planes uncovered their crystal doors; / Strange powers and influences touched his life.

01.03_006:022 - A vision came of higher realms than ours, / A consciousness of brighter fields and skies, / Of beings less circumscribed than brief-lived men / And subtler bodies than these passing frames, / Objects too fine for our material grasp, / Acts vibrant with a superhuman light / And movements pushed by a superconscient force, / And joys that never flowed through mortal limbs, / And lovelier scenes than earth’s and happier lives.

01.03_006:023 - A consciousness of beauty and of bliss, / A knowledge which became what it perceived, / Replaced the separated sense and heart / And drew all Nature into its embrace.

01.03_006:024 - The mind leaned out to meet the hidden worlds.

01.03_006:025 - Air glowed and teemed with marvellous shapes and hues, / In the nostrils quivered celestial fragrances, / On the tongue lingered the honey of paradise.

01.03_006:026 - A channel of universal harmony, / Hearing was a stream of magic audience, / A bed for occult sounds earth cannot hear.

01.03_006:027 - Out of a covert tract of slumber self / The voice came of a truth submerged, unknown / That flows beneath the cosmic surfaces / Only mid an omniscient silence heard, / Held by intuitive heart and secret sense.

01.03_006:028 - It caught the burden of secrecies sealed and dumb, / It voiced the unfulfilled demand of earth / And the song of promise of unrealised heavens / And all that hides in an omnipotent Sleep.

01.03_006:029 - In the unceasing drama carried by Time / On its long listening flood that bears the world’s / Insoluble doubt on a pilgrimage without goal, / A laughter of sleepless pleasure foamed and spumed / And murmurings of desire that cannot die: / A cry came of the world’s delight to be, / The grandeur and greatness of its will to live, / Recall of the soul’s adventure into space, / A traveller through the magic centuries / And being’s labour in Matter’s universe, / Its search for the mystic meaning of its birth / And joy of high spiritual response / Its throb of satisfaction and content, / In all the sweetness of the gifts of life, / Its large breath and pulse and thrill of hope and fear, / Its taste of pangs and tears and ecstasy, / Its rapture’s poignant beat of sudden bliss, / The sob of its passion and unending pain.

01.03_006:030 - The murmur and whisper of the unheard sounds / Which crowd around our hearts but find no window / To enter, swelled into a canticle / Of all that suffers to be still unknown / And all that labours vainly to be born / And all the sweetness none will ever taste / And all the beauty that will never be.

01.03_006:031 - Inaudible to our deaf mortal ears / The wide world-rhythms wove their stupendous chant / To which life strives to fit our rhyme-beats here, / Melting our limits in the illimitable, / Tuning the finite to infinity.

01.03_006:032 - A low muttering rose from the subconscient caves, / The stammer of the primal ignorance; / Answer to that inarticulate questioning, / There stooped with lightning neck and thunder’s wings / A radiant hymn to the Inexpressible / And the anthem of the superconscient light.

01.03_006:033 - All was revealed there none can here express; / Vision and dream were fables spoken by truth / Or symbols more veridical than fact, / Or were truths enforced by supernatural seals.

01.03_006:034 - Immortal eyes approached and looked in his, / And beings of many kingdoms neared and spoke: / The ever-living whom we name as dead / Could leave their glory beyond death and birth / To utter the wisdom which exceeds all phrase: / The kings of evil and the kings of good, / Appellants at the reason’s judgment seat, / Proclaimed the gospel of their opposites, / And all believed themselves spokesmen of God: / The gods of light and titans of the dark / Battled for his soul as for a costly prize.

01.03_006:035 - In every hour loosed from the quiver of Time / There rose a song of new discovery, / A bow-twang’s hum of young experiment.

01.03_006:036 - Each day was a spiritual romance, / As if he was born into a bright new world; / Adventure leaped an unexpected friend, / And danger brought a keen sweet tang of joy: / Each happening was a deep experience.

01.03_006:037 - There were high encounters, epic colloquies, / And counsels came couched in celestial speech, / And honeyed pleadings breathed from occult lips / To help the heart to yield to rapture’s call, / And sweet temptations stole from beauty’s realms / And sudden ecstasies from a world of bliss.

01.03_006:038 - It was a reign of wonder and delight; / All now his bright clairaudience could receive, / A contact thrilled of mighty unknown things.

01.03_006:039 - Awakened to new unearthly closenesses, / The touch replied to subtle infinities, / And with a silver cry of opening gates / Sight’s lightnings leaped into the invisible.

01.03_006:040 - Ever his consciousness and vision grew; / They took an ampler sweep, a loftier flight; / He passed the border marked for Matter’s rule / And passed the zone where thought replaces life.

01.03_006:041 - Out of this world of signs suddenly he came / Into a silent self where world was not / And looked beyond into a nameless vast.

01.03_006:042 - These symbol figures lost their right to live, / All tokens dropped our sense can recognise; / There the heart beat no more at body’s touch, / There the eyes gazed no more on beauty’s shape.

01.03_006:043 - In rare and lucent intervals of hush / Into a signless region he could soar / Packed with the deep contents of formlessness / Where world was into a single being rapt / And all was known by the light of identity / And spirit was its own self-evidence.

01.03_006:044 - The Supreme’s gaze looked out through human eyes / And saw all things and creatures as itself / And knew all thought and word as its own voice.

01.03_006:045 - There unity is too close for search and clasp / And love is a yearning of the One for the One, / And beauty is a sweet difference of the Same / And oneness is the soul of multitude.

01.03_006:046 - There all the truths unite in a single truth, / And all ideas rejoin Reality.

01.03_006:047 - There knowing herself by her own termless self, / Wisdom supernal, wordless, absolute / Sat uncompanioned in the eternal Calm, / All-seeing, motionless, sovereign and alone.

01.03_006:048 - There knowledge needs not words to embody Idea; / Idea seeking a house in boundlessness, / Weary of its homeless immortality, / Asks not in thought’s carved brilliant cell to rest / Whose single window’s clipped outlook on things / Sees only a little arc of God’s vast sky.

01.03_006:049 - The boundless with the boundless there consorts; / While there, one can be wider than the world; / While there, one is one’s own infinity.

01.03_006:050 - His centre was no more in earthly mind, / A power of seeing silence filled his limbs: / Caught by a voiceless white epiphany / Into a vision that surpasses forms, / Into a living that surpasses life, / He neared the still consciousness sustaining all.

01.03_006:051 - The voice that only by speech can move the mind / Became a silent knowledge in the soul; / The strength that only in action feels its truth / Was lodged now in a mute omnipotent peace.

01.03_006:052 - A leisure in the labour of the worlds, / A pause in the joy and anguish of the search / Restored the stress of Nature to God’s calm.

01.03_006:053 - A vast unanimity ended life’s debate.

01.03_006:054 - The war of thoughts that fathers the universe, / The clash of forces struggling to prevail / In the tremendous shock that lights a star / As in the building of a grain of dust, / The grooves that turn their dumb ellipse in space / Ploughed by the seeking of the world’s desire, / The long regurgitations in Time’s flood, / The torment edging the dire force of lust / That wakes kinetic in earth’s dullard slime / And carves a personality out of mud, / The sorrow by which Nature’s hunger is fed, / The oestrus which creates with fire of pain, / The fate that punishes virtue with defeat, / The tragedy that destroys long happiness, / The weeping of Love, the quarrel of the Gods, / Ceased in a truth which lives in its own light.

01.03_006:055t - His soul stood free, a witness and a king. #first-step #first-transformation #king #psychic-being #siddhi #soul #witness #yoga

01.03_006:056 - Absorbed no more in the moment-ridden flux / Where mind incessantly drifts as on a raft / Hurried from phenomenon to phenomenon, / He abode at rest in indivisible Time.

01.03_006:057 - As if a story long written but acted now, / In his present he held his future and his past, / Felt in the seconds the uncounted years / And saw the hours like dots upon a page.

01.03_006:058 - An aspect of the unknown Reality / Altered the meaning of the cosmic scene.

01.03_006:059 - This huge material universe became / A small result of a stupendous force: / Overtaking the moment the eternal Ray / Illumined that which never yet was made.

01.03_006:060 - Thought lay down in a mighty voicelessness; / The toiling thinker widened and grew still, / Wisdom transcendent touched his quivering heart: / His soul could sail beyond thought’s luminous bar; / Mind screened no more the shoreless infinite.

01.03_006:061 - Across a void retreating sky he glimpsed / Through a last glimmer and drift of vanishing stars / The superconscient realms of motionless peace / Where judgment ceases and the word is mute / And the Unconceived lies pathless and alone.

01.03_006:062 - There came not form or any mounting voice; / There only were Silence and the Absolute.

01.03_006:063 - Out of that stillness mind new-born arose / And woke to truths once inexpressible, / And forms appeared, dumbly significant, / A seeing thought, a self-revealing voice.

01.03_006:064 - He knew the source from which his spirit came: / Movement was married to the immobile Vast; / He plunged his roots into the Infinite, / He based his life upon Eternity.



Section I - 7: a constant lodging


01.03_007:001 - Only a while at first these heavenlier states, / These large wide-poised upliftings could endure.

01.03_007:002 - The high and luminous tension breaks too soon, / The body’s stone stillness and the life’s hushed trance, / The breathless might and calm of silent mind; / Or slowly they fail as sets a golden day.

01.03_007:003 - The restless nether members tire of peace; / A nostalgia of old little works and joys, / A need to call back small familiar selves, / To tread the accustomed and inferior way, / The need to rest in a natural poise of fall, / As a child who learns to walk can walk not long, / Replace the titan will for ever to climb, / On the heart’s altar dim the sacred fire.

01.03_007:004 - An old pull of subconscious cords renews; / It draws the unwilling spirit from the heights, / Or a dull gravitation drags us down / To the blind driven inertia of our base.

01.03_007:005 - This too the supreme Diplomat can use, / He makes our fall a means for greater rise.

01.03_007:006 - For into the ignorant nature’s gusty field, / Into the half-ordered chaos of mortal life / The formless Power, the Self of eternal light / Follow in the shadow of the spirit’s descent; / The twin duality for ever one / Chooses its home mid the tumults of the sense.

01.03_007:007 - He comes unseen into our darker parts / And, curtained by the darkness, does his work, / A subtle and all-knowing guest and guide, / Till they too feel the need and will to change.

01.03_007:008 - All here must learn to obey a higher law, / Our body’s cells must hold the Immortal’s flame.

01.03_007:009 - Else would the spirit reach alone its source / Leaving a half-saved world to its dubious fate.

01.03_007:010 - Nature would ever labour unredeemed; / Our earth would ever spin unhelped in space, / And this immense creation’s purpose fail / Till at last the frustrate universe sank undone.

01.03_007:011 - Even his godlike strength to rise must fall: / His greater consciousness withdrew behind; / Dim and eclipsed, his human outside strove / To feel again the old sublimities, / Bring the high saving touch, the ethereal flame, / Call back to its dire need the divine Force.

01.03_007:012 - Always the power poured back like sudden rain, / Or slowly in his breast a presence grew, / It clambered back to some remembered height / Or soared above the peak from which it fell.

01.03_007:013 - Each time he rose there was a larger poise, / A dwelling on a higher spirit plane; / The Light remained in him a longer space.

01.03_007:014 - In this oscillation between earth and heaven, / In this ineffable communion’s climb / There grew in him as grows a waxing moon / The glory of the integer of his soul.

01.03_007:015 - A union of the Real with the unique, / A gaze of the Alone from every face, / The Presence of the Eternal in the hours / Widening the mortal mind’s half-look on things, / Bridging the gap between man’s force and Fate / Made whole the fragment-being we are here.

01.03_007:016 - At last was won a firm spiritual poise, / A constant lodging in the Eternal’s realm, / A safety in the Silence and the Ray, / A settlement in the Immutable.

01.03_007:017 - His heights of being lived in the still Self; / His mind could rest on a supernal ground / And look down on the magic and the play / Where the God-child lies on the lap of Night and Dawn / And the Everlasting puts on Time’s disguise.

01.03_007:018 - To the still heights and to the troubled depths / His equal spirit gave its vast assent: / A poised serenity of tranquil strength, / A wide unshaken look on Time’s unrest / Faced all experience with unaltered peace.

01.03_007:019t - Indifferent to the sorrow and delight, / Untempted by the marvel and the call, / Immobile it beheld the flux of things, / Calm and apart supported all that is: / His spirit’s stillness helped the toiling world. #divine-immunity #divine-support #freedom #ishwara #power-of-stillness #purusha #spirit #spiritual-power #witness

01.03_007:020 - Inspired by silence and the closed eyes’ sight / His force could work with a new luminous art / On the crude material from which all is made / And the refusal of Inertia’s mass / And the grey front of the world’s Ignorance / And nescient Matter and the huge error of life.

01.03_007:021 - As a sculptor chisels a deity out of stone / He slowly chipped off the dark envelope, / Line of defence of Nature’s ignorance, / The illusion and mystery of the Inconscient / In whose black pall the Eternal wraps his head / That he may act unknown in cosmic Time.

01.03_007:022 - A splendour of self-creation from the peaks, / A transfiguration in the mystic depths, / A happier cosmic working could begin / And fashion the world-shape in him anew, / God found in Nature, Nature fulfilled in God.

01.03_007:023 - Already in him was seen that task of Power: / Life made its home on the high tops of self; / His soul, mind, heart became a single sun; / Only life’s lower reaches remained dim.

01.03_007:024 - But there too, in the uncertain shadow of life, / There was a labour and a fiery breath; / The ambiguous cowled celestial puissance worked / Watched by the inner Witness’s moveless peace.

01.03_007:025 - Even on the struggling Nature left below / Strong periods of illumination came: / Lightnings of glory after glory burned, / Experience was a tale of blaze and fire, / Air rippled round the argosies of the Gods, / Strange riches sailed to him from the Unseen; / Splendours of insight filled the blank of thought, / Knowledge spoke to the inconscient stillnesses, / Rivers poured down of bliss and luminous force, / Visits of beauty, storm-sweeps of delight / Rained from the all-powerful Mystery above.

01.03_007:026 - Thence stooped the eagles of Omniscience.

01.03_007:027 - A dense veil was rent, a mighty whisper heard; / Repeated in the privacy of his soul, / A wisdom-cry from rapt transcendences / Sang on the mountains of an unseen world; / The voices that an inner listening hears / Conveyed to him their prophet utterances, / And flame-wrapt outbursts of the immortal Word / And flashes of an occult revealing Light / Approached him from the unreachable secrecy.

01.03_007:028 - An inspired Knowledge sat enthroned within / Whose seconds illumined more than reason’s years: / An ictus of revealing lustre fell / As if a pointing accent upon Truth, / And like a sky-flare showing all the ground / A swift intuitive discernment shone.

01.03_007:029 - One glance could separate the true and false, / Or raise its rapid torch-fire in the dark / To check the claimants crowding through mind’s gates / Covered by the forged signatures of the gods, / Detect the magic bride in her disguise / Or scan the apparent face of thought and life. #favorite #viveka #discernment #jnana #satya


Section I - 8: she broke in


01.03_008:001 - Oft inspiration with her lightning feet, / A sudden messenger from the all-seeing tops, / Traversed the soundless corridors of his mind / Bringing her rhythmic sense of hidden things.

01.03_008:002 - A music spoke transcending mortal speech.

01.03_008:003 - As if from a golden phial of the All-Bliss, / A joy of light, a joy of sudden sight, / A rapture of the thrilled undying Word / Poured into his heart as into an empty cup, / A repetition of God’s first delight / Creating in a young and virgin Time.

01.03_008:004 - In a brief moment caught, a little space, / All-Knowledge packed into great wordless thoughts / Lodged in the expectant stillness of his depths / A crystal of the ultimate Absolute, / A portion of the inexpressible Truth / Revealed by silence to the silent soul.

01.03_008:005 - The intense creatrix in his stillness wrought; / Her power fallen speechless grew more intimate; / She looked upon the seen and the unforeseen, / Unguessed domains she made her native field.

01.03_008:006 - All-vision gathered into a single ray, / As when the eyes stare at an invisible point / Till through the intensity of one luminous spot / An apocalypse of a world of images / Enters into the kingdom of the seer.

01.03_008:007 - A great nude arm of splendour suddenly rose; / It rent the gauze opaque of Nescience: / Her lifted finger’s keen unthinkable tip / Bared with a stab of flame the closed Beyond.

01.03_008:008Bt - An eye awake in voiceless heights of trance, / A mind plucking at the unimaginable, / Overleaping with a sole and perilous bound / The high black wall hiding superconscience, / She broke in with inspired speech for scythe / And plundered the Unknowable’s vast estate. #divine-method #power-of-inspiration #spiritual-success #success-in-sadhana #superconscience #treasure #unknowable #yoga

01.03_008:009 - A gleaner of infinitesimal grains of Truth, / A sheaf-binder of infinite experience, / She pierced the guarded mysteries of World-Force / And her magic methods wrapt in a thousand veils; / Or she gathered the lost secrets dropped by Time / In the dust and crannies of his mounting route / Mid old forsaken dreams of hastening Mind / And buried remnants of forgotten space.

01.03_008:010 - A traveller between summit and abyss / She joined the distant ends, the viewless deeps, / Or streaked along the roads of Heaven and Hell / Pursuing all knowledge like a questing hound.

01.03_008:011 - A reporter and scribe of hidden wisdom talk, / Her shining minutes of celestial speech, / Passed through the masked office of the occult mind, / Transmitting gave to prophet and to seer / The inspired body of the mystic Truth.

01.03_008:012 - A recorder of the inquiry of the gods, / Spokesman of the silent seeings of the Supreme, / She brought immortal words to mortal men.

01.03_008:013 - Above the reason’s brilliant slender curve, / Released like radiant air dimming a moon, / Broad spaces of a vision without line / Or limit swam into his spirit’s ken.

01.03_008:014 - Oceans of being met his voyaging soul / Calling to infinite discovery; / Timeless domains of joy and absolute power / Stretched out surrounded by the eternal hush; / The ways that lead to endless happiness / Ran like dream-smiles through meditating vasts: / Disclosed stood up in a gold moment’s blaze / White sun-steppes in the pathless Infinite.

01.03_008:015 - Along a naked curve in bourneless Self / The points that run through the closed heart of things / Shadowed the indeterminable line / That carries the Everlasting through the years.

01.03_008:016 - The magician order of the cosmic Mind / Coercing the freedom of infinity / With the stark array of Nature’s symbol facts / And life’s incessant signals of event, / Transmuted chance recurrences into laws, / A chaos of signs into a universe.

01.03_008:017 - Out of the rich wonders and the intricate whorls / Of the spirit’s dance with Matter as its mask / The balance of the world’s design grew clear, / Its symmetry of self-arranged effects / Managed in the deep perspectives of the soul, / And the realism of its illusive art, / Its logic of infinite intelligence, / Its magic of a changing eternity.

01.03_008:018 - A glimpse was caught of things for ever unknown / The letters stood out of the unmoving Word.

01.03_008:019 - In the immutable nameless Origin / Was seen emerging as from fathomless seas / The trail of the Ideas that made the world, / And, sown in the black earth of Nature’s trance, / The seed of the Spirit’s blind and huge desire / From which the tree of cosmos was conceived / And spread its magic arms through a dream of space.

01.03_008:020 - Immense realities took on a shape: / There looked out from the shadow of the Unknown / The bodiless Namelessness that saw God born / And tries to gain from the mortal’s mind and soul / A deathless body and a divine name.

01.03_008:021 - The immobile lips, the great surreal wings, / The visage masked by superconscient Sleep, / The eyes with their closed lids that see all things, / Appeared of the Architect who builds in trance.

01.03_008:022 - The original Desire born in the Void / Peered out; he saw the hope that never sleeps, / The feet that run behind a fleeting fate, / The ineffable meaning of the endless dream.

01.03_008:023 - As if a torch held by a power of God, / The radiant world of the everlasting Truth / Glimmered like a faint star bordering the night / Above the golden Overmind’s shimmering ridge.

01.03_008:024 - Even were caught as through a cunning veil / The smile of love that sanctions the long game, / The calm indulgence and maternal breasts / Of Wisdom suckling the child-laughter of Chance, / Silence the nurse of the Almighty’s power, / The omniscient hush, womb of the immortal Word, / And of the Timeless the still brooding face, / And the creative eye of Eternity.

01.03_008:025 - The inspiring goddess entered a mortal’s breast, / Made there her study of divining thought / And sanctuary of prophetic speech / And sat upon the tripod seat of mind: / All was made wide above, all lit below.

01.03_008:026 - In darkness’ core she dug out wells of light, / On the undiscovered depths imposed a form, / Lent a vibrant cry to the unuttered vasts, / And through great shoreless, voiceless, starless breadths / Bore earthward fragments of revealing thought / Hewn from the silence of the Ineffable.

01.03_008:027 - A voice in the heart uttered the unspoken Name, / A dream of seeking thought wandering through space / Entered the invisible and forbidden house: / The treasure was found of a supernal Day.

01.03_008:028 - In the deep subconscient glowed her jewel-lamp; / Lifted, it showed the riches of the Cave / Where, by the miser traffickers of sense / Unused, guarded beneath Night’s dragon paws, / In folds of velvet darkness draped they sleep / Whose priceless value could have saved the world.

01.03_008:029 - A darkness carrying morning in its breast / Looked for the eternal wide returning gleam, / Waiting the advent of a larger ray / And rescue of the lost herds of the Sun.

01.03_008:030 - In a splendid extravagance of the waste of God / Dropped carelessly in creation’s spendthrift work, / Left in the chantiers of the bottomless world / And stolen by the robbers of the Deep, / The golden shekels of the Eternal lie, / Hoarded from touch and view and thought’s desire, / Locked in blind antres of the ignorant flood / Lest men should find them and be even as Gods.

01.03_008:031 - A vision lightened on the viewless heights, / A wisdom illumined from the voiceless depths: / A deeper interpretation greatened Truth, / A grand reversal of the Night and Day; / All the world’s values changed heightening life’s aim; / A wiser word, a larger thought came in / Than what the slow labour of human mind can bring, / A secret sense awoke that could perceive / A Presence and a Greatness everywhere.

01.03_008:032 - The universe was not now this senseless whirl / Borne round inert on an immense machine; / It cast away its grandiose lifeless front, / A mechanism no more or work of Chance, / But a living movement of the body of God.

01.03_008:033 - A spirit hid in forces and in forms / Was the spectator of the mobile scene: / The beauty and the ceaseless miracle / Let in a glow of the Unmanifest: / The formless Everlasting moved in it / Seeking its own perfect form in souls and things.

01.03_008:034 - Life kept no more a dull and meaningless shape.

01.03_008:035 - In the struggle and upheaval of the world / He saw the labour of a godhead’s birth: / A secret knowledge masked as Ignorance; / Fate covered with unseen necessity / The game of chance of an omnipotent Will.

01.03_008:036 - A glory and a rapture and a charm, / The All-Blissful sat unknown within the heart; / Earth’s pains were the ransom of its prisoned delight.

01.03_008:037 - A glad communion tinged the passing hours; / The days were travellers on a destined road, / The nights companions of his musing spirit.

01.03_008:038 - A heavenly impetus quickened all his breast; / The trudge of time changed to a splendid march; / The divine Dwarf towered to unconquered worlds, / Earth grew too narrow for his victory.

01.03_008:039 - Once only registering the heavy tread / Of a blind Power on human littleness, / Life now became a sure approach to God, / Existence a divine experiment / And cosmos the soul’s opportunity.

01.03_008:040 - The world was a conception and a birth / Of Spirit in Matter into living forms, / And Nature bore the Immortal in her womb, / That she might climb through him to eternal life.

01.03_008:041 - His being lay down in bright immobile peace / And bathed in wells of pure spiritual light; / It wandered in wide fields of wisdom-self / Lit by the rays of an everlasting sun.

01.03_008:042 - Even his body’s subtle self within / Could raise the earthly parts towards higher things / And feel on it the breath of heavenlier air.

01.03_008:043 - Already it journeyed towards divinity: / Upbuoyed upon winged winds of rapid joy, / Upheld to a Light it could not always hold, / It left mind’s distance from the Truth supreme / And lost life’s incapacity for bliss.

01.03_008:044 - All now suppressed in us began to emerge.



Section I - 9: acts betrayed not


01.03_009:001 - Thus came his soul’s release from Ignorance, / His mind and body’s first spiritual change.

01.03_009:002 - A wide God-knowledge poured down from above, / A new world-knowledge broadened from within: / His daily thoughts looked up to the True and One, / His commonest doings welled from an inner Light.

01.03_009:003 - Awakened to the lines that Nature hides, / Attuned to her movements that exceed our ken, / He grew one with a covert universe.

01.03_009:004 - His grasp surprised her mightiest energies’ springs; / He spoke with the unknown Guardians of the worlds, / Forms he descried our mortal eyes see not.

01.03_009:005 - His wide eyes bodied viewless entities, / He saw the cosmic forces at their work / And felt the occult impulse behind man’s will.

01.03_009:006 - Time’s secrets were to him an oft-read book; / The records of the future and the past / Outlined their excerpts on the etheric page.

01.03_009:007 - One and harmonious by the Maker’s skill, / The human in him paced with the divine.

01.03_009:008 - His acts betrayed not the interior flame.

01.03_009:009 - This forged the greatness of his front to earth.

01.03_009:010 - A genius heightened in his body’s cells / That knew the meaning of his fate-hedged works / Akin to the march of unaccomplished Powers / Beyond life’s arc in spirit’s immensities.

01.03_009:011 - Apart he lived in his mind’s solitude, / A demigod shaping the lives of men: / One soul’s ambition lifted up the race; / A Power worked, but none knew whence it came.

01.03_009:012 - The universal strengths were linked with his; / Feeling earth’s smallness with their boundless breadths, / He drew the energies that transmute an age.

01.03_009:013 - Immeasurable by the common look, / He made great dreams a mould for coming things / And cast his deeds like bronze to front the years.

01.03_009:014 - His walk through Time outstripped the human stride.

01.03_009:015 - Lonely his days and splendid like the sun’s.


Canto 4 - 1.4: The Secret Knowledge

Section I - 10: a living image


01.04_010:001 - On a height he stood that looked towards greater heights.

01.04_010:002 - Our early approaches to the Infinite / Are sunrise splendours on a marvellous verge / While lingers yet unseen the glorious sun.

01.04_010:003 - What now we see is a shadow of what must come. #favorite

01.04_010:004 - The earth’s uplook to a remote unknown / Is a preface only of the epic climb / Of human soul from its flat earthly state / To the discovery of a greater self / And the far gleam of an eternal Light.

01.04_010:005 - This world is a beginning and a base / Where Life and Mind erect their structured dreams; / An unborn Power must build reality.

01.04_010:006 - A deathbound littleness is not all we are: / Immortal our forgotten vastnesses / Await discovery in our summit selves; / Unmeasured breadths and depths of being are ours.

01.04_010:007 - Akin to the ineffable secrecy, / Mystic, eternal in unrealised Time, / Neighbours of Heaven are Nature’s altitudes.

01.04_010:008 - To these high-peaked dominions sealed to our search / Too far from surface Nature’s postal routes, / Too lofty for our mortal lives to breathe, / Deep in us a forgotten kinship points / And a faint voice of ecstasy and prayer / Calls to those lucent lost immensities.

01.04_010:009B - Even when we fail to look into our souls / Or lie embedded in earthly consciousness, / Still have we parts that grow towards the Light, / Yet are there luminous tracts and heavens serene / And Eldoradoes of splendour and ecstasy / And temples to the Godhead none can see.

01.04_010:010 - A shapeless memory lingers in us still / And sometimes, when our sight is turned within, / Earth’s ignorant veil is lifted from our eyes; / There is a short miraculous escape.

01.04_010:011 - This narrow fringe of clamped experience / We leave behind meted to us as life, / Our little walks, our insufficient reach.

01.04_010:012 - Our souls can visit in great lonely hours / Still regions of imperishable Light, / All-seeing eagle-peaks of silent Power / And moon-flame oceans of swift fathomless Bliss / And calm immensities of spirit Space.

01.04_010:013 - In the unfolding process of the Self / Sometimes the inexpressible Mystery / Elects a human vessel of descent.

01.04_010:014 - A breath comes down from a supernal air, / A presence is borne, a guiding Light awakes, / A stillness falls upon the instruments: / Fixed sometimes like a marble monument, / Stone-calm, the body is a pedestal / Supporting a figure of eternal Peace.

01.04_010:015 - Or a revealing Force sweeps blazing in; / Out of some vast superior continent / Knowledge breaks through trailing its radiant seas, / And Nature trembles with the power, the flame.

01.04_010:016 - A greater Personality sometimes / Possesses us which yet we know is ours: / Or we adore the Master of our souls.

01.04_010:017 - Then the small bodily ego thins and falls; / No more insisting on its separate self, / Losing the punctilio of its separate birth, / It leaves us one with Nature and with God.

01.04_010:018 - In moments when the inner lamps are lit / And the life’s cherished guests are left outside, / Our spirit sits alone and speaks to its gulfs.

01.04_010:019 - A wider consciousness opens then its doors; / Invading from spiritual silences / A ray of the timeless Glory stoops awhile / To commune with our seized illumined clay / And leaves its huge white stamp upon our lives.

01.04_010:020 - In the oblivious field of mortal mind, / Revealed to the closed prophet eyes of trance / Or in some deep internal solitude / Witnessed by a strange immaterial sense, / The signals of eternity appear.

01.04_010:021 - The truth mind could not know unveils its face, / We hear what mortal ears have never heard, / We feel what earthly sense has never felt, / We love what common hearts repel and dread; / Our minds hush to a bright Omniscient; / A Voice calls from the chambers of the soul; / We meet the ecstasy of the Godhead’s touch / In golden privacies of immortal fire.

01.04_010:022 - These signs are native to a larger self / That lives within us by ourselves unseen; / Only sometimes a holier influence comes, / A tide of mightier surgings bears our lives / And a diviner Presence moves the soul.

01.04_010:023 - Or through the earthly coverings something breaks, / A grace and beauty of spiritual light, / The murmuring tongue of a celestial fire.

01.04_010:024 - Ourself and a high stranger whom we feel, / It is and acts unseen as if it were not; / It follows the line of sempiternal birth, / Yet seems to perish with its mortal frame.

01.04_010:025 - Assured of the Apocalypse to be, / It reckons not the moments and the hours; / Great, patient, calm it sees the centuries pass, / Awaiting the slow miracle of our change / In the sure deliberate process of world-force / And the long march of all-revealing Time.

01.04_010:026 - It is the origin and the master-clue, / A Silence overhead, an inner Voice, / A living image seated in the heart, / An unwalled wideness and a fathomless point, / The truth of all these cryptic shows in space, / The Real towards which our strivings move, / The secret grandiose meaning of our lives.

01.04_010:027 - A treasure of honey in the combs of God, / A Splendour burning in a tenebrous cloak, / It is our glory of the flame of God, / Our golden fountain of the world’s delight, / An immortality cowled in the cape of death, / The shape of our unborn divinity.

01.04_010:028 - It guards for us our fate in depths within / Where sleeps the eternal seed of transient things.

01.04_010:029 - Always we bear in us a magic key / Concealed in life’s hermetic envelope.

01.04_010:030 - A burning witness in the sanctuary / Regards through Time and the blind walls of Form; / A timeless Light is in his hidden eyes; / He sees the secret things no words can speak / And knows the goal of the unconscious world / And the heart of the mystery of the journeying years.



Section I - 11: few who answer


01.04_011:001 - But all is screened, subliminal, mystical; / It needs the intuitive heart, the inward turn, / It needs the power of a spiritual gaze.

01.04_011:002 - Else to our waking mind’s small moment look / A goalless voyage seems our dubious course / Some Chance has settled or hazarded some Will, / Or a Necessity without aim or cause / Unwillingly compelled to emerge and be.

01.04_011:003 - In this dense field where nothing is plain or sure, / Our very being seems to us questionable, / Our life a vague experiment, the soul / A flickering light in a strange ignorant world, / The earth a brute mechanic accident, / A net of death in which by chance we live.

01.04_011:004 - All we have learned appears a doubtful guess, / The achievement done a passage or a phase / Whose further end is hidden from our sight, / A chance happening or a fortuitous fate.

01.04_011:005 - Out of the unknown we move to the unknown.

01.04_011:006 - Ever surround our brief existence here / Grey shadows of unanswered questionings; / The dark Inconscient’s signless mysteries / Stand up unsolved behind Fate’s starting line; / An aspiration in the Night’s profound, / Seed of a perishing body and half-lit mind, / Uplifts its lonely tongue of conscious fire / Towards an undying Light for ever lost.

01.04_011:007 - Only it hears, sole echo of its call, / The dim reply in man’s unknowing heart / And meets, not understanding why it came / Or for what reason is the suffering here, / God’s sanction to the paradox of life / And the riddle of the Immortal’s birth in Time.

01.04_011:008 - Along a path of aeons serpentine / In the coiled blackness of her nescient course / The Earth-Goddess toils across the sands of Time.

01.04_011:009 - A Being is in her whom she hopes to know, / A Word speaks to her heart she cannot hear, / A Fate compels whose form she cannot see.

01.04_011:010 - In her unconscious orbit through the Void / Out of her mindless depths she strives to rise, / A perilous life her gain, a struggling joy; / A Thought that can conceive but hardly knows / Arises slowly in her and creates / The idea, the speech that labels more than it lights; / A trembling gladness that is less than bliss / Invades from all this beauty that must die.

01.04_011:011t - Alarmed by the sorrow dragging at her feet / And conscious of the high things not yet won, / Ever she nurses in her sleepless breast / An inward urge that takes from her rest and peace. #awakening #cost-of-consciousness #divine-beginnings #divine-means #divine-method #divine-urge #waking-up

01.04_011:012 - Ignorant and weary and invincible / She seeks through the soul’s war and quivering pain / The pure perfection her marred nature needs, / A breath of Godhead on her stone and mire.

01.04_011:013 - A faith she craves that can survive defeat, / The sureness of a love that knows not death, / The radiance of a truth for ever sure.

01.04_011:014 - A light grows in her, she assumes a voice, / Her state she learns to read and the act she has done, / But the one needed truth eludes her grasp, / Herself and all of which she is the sign.

01.04_011:015 - An inarticulate whisper drives her steps / Of which she feels the force but not the sense; / A few rare intimations come as guides, / Immense divining flashes cleave her brain, / And sometimes in her hours of dream and muse / The truth that she has missed looks out on her / As if far off and yet within her soul.

01.04_011:016 - A change comes near that flees from her surmise / And, ever postponed, compels attempt and hope, / Yet seems too great for mortal hope to dare.

01.04_011:017 - A vision meets her of supernal Powers / That draw her as if mighty kinsmen lost / Approaching with estranged great luminous gaze.

01.04_011:018 - Then is she moved to all that she is not / And stretches arms to what was never hers.

01.04_011:019 - Outstretching arms to the unconscious Void, / Passionate she prays to invisible forms of Gods / Soliciting from dumb Fate and toiling Time / What most she needs, what most exceeds her scope, / A Mind unvisited by illusion’s gleams, / A Will expressive of soul’s deity, / A Strength not forced to stumble by its speed, / A Joy that drags not sorrow as its shade.

01.04_011:020 - For these she yearns and feels them destined hers: / Heaven’s privilege she claims as her own right.

01.04_011:021 - Just is her claim the all-witnessing Gods approve, / Clear in a greater light than reason owns: / Our intuitions are its title-deeds; / Our souls accept what our blind thoughts refuse.

01.04_011:022 - Earth’s winged chimeras are Truth’s steeds in Heaven, / The impossible God’s sign of things to be.

01.04_011:023 - But few can look beyond the present state / Or overleap this matted hedge of sense.

01.04_011:024 - All that transpires on earth and all beyond / Are parts of an illimitable plan / The One keeps in his heart and knows alone.

01.04_011:025 - Our outward happenings have their seed within, / And even this random Fate that imitates Chance, / This mass of unintelligible results, / Are the dumb graph of truths that work unseen: / The laws of the Unknown create the known.

01.04_011:026 - The events that shape the appearance of our lives / Are a cipher of subliminal quiverings / Which rarely we surprise or vaguely feel, / Are an outcome of suppressed realities / That hardly rise into material day: / They are born from the spirit’s sun of hidden powers / Digging a tunnel through emergency.

01.04_011:027 - But who shall pierce into the cryptic gulf / And learn what deep necessity of the soul / Determined casual deed and consequence?

01.04_011:028 - Absorbed in a routine of daily acts, / Our eyes are fixed on an external scene; / We hear the crash of the wheels of Circumstance / And wonder at the hidden cause of things.

01.04_011:029 - Yet a foreseeing Knowledge might be ours, / If we could take our spirit’s stand within, / If we could hear the muffled daemon voice.

01.04_011:030 - Too seldom is the shadow of what must come / Cast in an instant on the secret sense / Which feels the shock of the invisible, / And seldom in the few who answer give / The mighty process of the cosmic Will / Communicates its image to our sight, / Identifying the world’s mind with ours.

01.04_011:031 - Our range is fixed within the crowded arc / Of what we observe and touch and thought can guess / And rarely dawns the light of the Unknown / Waking in us the prophet and the seer.

01.04_011:032t - The outward and the immediate are our field, / The dead past is our background and support; / Mind keeps the soul prisoner, we are slaves to our acts; / We cannot free our gaze to reach wisdom’s sun. #difficulties #limitations #limits-of-consciousness #need-for-freedom #self-imprisonment #slavery #sun #the-goal #wisdom

01.04_011:033 - Inheritor of the brief animal mind, / Man, still a child in Nature’s mighty hands, / In the succession of the moments lives; / To a changing present is his narrow right; / His memory stares back at a phantom past, / The future flees before him as he moves; / He sees imagined garments, not a face.

01.04_011:034 - Armed with a limited precarious strength, / He saves his fruits of work from adverse chance.

01.04_011:035 - A struggling ignorance is his wisdom’s mate.

01.04_011:036 - He waits to see the consequence of his acts, / He waits to weigh the certitude of his thoughts, / He knows not what he shall achieve or when; / He knows not whether at last he shall survive, / Or end like the mastodon and the sloth / And perish from the earth where he was king.

01.04_011:037 - He is ignorant of the meaning of his life, / He is ignorant of his high and splendid fate.

01.04_011:038 - Only the Immortals on their deathless heights / Dwelling beyond the walls of Time and Space, / Masters of living, free from the bonds of Thought, / Who are overseers of Fate and Chance and Will / And experts of the theorem of world-need, / Can see the Idea, the Might that change Time’s course, / Come maned with light from undiscovered worlds, / Hear, while the world toils on with its deep blind heart, / The galloping hooves of the unforeseen event, / Bearing the superhuman rider, near / And, impassive to earth’s din and startled cry, / Return to the silence of the hills of God; / As lightning leaps, as thunder sweeps, they pass / And leave their mark on the trampled breast of Life.

01.04_011:039 - Above the world the world-creators stand, / In the phenomenon see its mystic source.

01.04_011:040 - These heed not the deceiving outward play, / They turn not to the moment’s busy tramp, / But listen with the still patience of the Unborn / For the slow footsteps of far Destiny / Approaching through huge distances of Time, / Unmarked by the eye that sees effect and cause, / Unheard mid the clamour of the human plane.

01.04_011:041 - Attentive to an unseen Truth they seize / A sound as of invisible augur wings, / Voices of an unplumbed significance, / Mutterings that brood in the core of Matter’s sleep.

01.04_011:042 - In the heart’s profound audition they can catch / The murmurs lost by life’s uncaring ear, / A prophet-speech in thought’s omniscient trance.

01.04_011:043 - Above the illusion of the hopes that pass, / Behind the appearance and the overt act, / Behind the clock-work chance and vague surmise, / Amid the wrestle of force, the trampling feet, / Across the triumph, fighting and despair, / They watch the Bliss for which earth’s heart has cried, / On the long road which cannot see its end / Winding undetected through the sceptic days / And to meet it guide the unheedful moving world.

01.04_011:044 - Thus will the masked Transcendent mount his throne.

01.04_011:045 - When darkness deepens strangling the earth’s breast / And man’s corporeal mind is the only lamp, / As a thief’s in the night shall be the covert tread / Of one who steps unseen into his house.

01.04_011:046 - A Voice ill-heard shall speak, the soul obey, / A power into mind’s inner chamber steal, / A charm and sweetness open life’s closed doors / And beauty conquer the resisting world, / The truth-light capture Nature by surprise, / A stealth of God compel the heart to bliss / And earth grow unexpectedly divine.

01.04_011:047 - In Matter shall be lit the spirit’s glow, / In body and body kindled the sacred birth; / Night shall awake to the anthem of the stars, / The days become a happy pilgrim march, / Our will a force of the Eternal’s power, / And thought the rays of a spiritual sun.

01.04_011:048 - A few shall see what none yet understands; / God shall grow up while the wise men talk and sleep; / For man shall not know the coming till its hour / And belief shall be not till the work is done.


Section I - 12: keeps for us safe


01.04_012:001 - A consciousness that knows not its own truth, / A vagrant hunter of misleading dawns, / Between the being’s dark and luminous ends / Moves here in a half-light that seems the whole: / An interregnum in Reality / Cuts off the integral Thought, the total Power; / It circles or stands in a vague interspace, / Doubtful of its beginning and its close, / Or runs upon a road that has no end; / Far from the original Dusk, the final Flame / In some huge void Inconscience it lives, / Like a thought persisting in a wide emptiness.

01.04_012:002 - As if an unintelligible phrase / Suggested a million renderings to the Mind, / It lends a purport to the random world.

01.04_012:003 - A conjecture leaning upon doubtful proofs, / A message misunderstood, a thought confused / Missing its aim is all that it can speak / Or a fragment of the universal word.

01.04_012:004 - It leaves two giant letters void of sense / While without sanction turns the middle sign / Carrying an enigmatic universe, / As if a present without future or past / Repeating the same revolution’s whirl / Turned on its axis in its own Inane.

01.04_012:005 - Thus is the meaning of creation veiled; / For without context reads the cosmic page: / Its signs stare at us like an unknown script, / As if appeared screened by a foreign tongue / Or code of splendour signs without a key / A portion of a parable sublime.

01.04_012:006 - It wears to the perishable creature’s eyes / The grandeur of a useless miracle; / Wasting itself that it may last awhile, / A river that can never find its sea, / It runs through life and death on an edge of Time; / A fire in the Night is its mighty action’s blaze.

01.04_012:007 - This is our deepest need to join once more / What now is parted, opposite and twain, / Remote in sovereign spheres that never meet / Or fronting like far poles of Night and Day.

01.04_012:008 - We must fill the immense lacuna we have made, / Re-wed the closed finite’s lonely consonant / With the open vowels of Infinity, / A hyphen must connect Matter and Mind, / The narrow isthmus of the ascending soul: / We must renew the secret bond in things, / Our hearts recall the lost divine Idea, / Reconstitute the perfect word, unite / The Alpha and the Omega in one sound; / Then shall the Spirit and Nature be at one.

01.04_012:009 - Two are the ends of the mysterious plan.

01.04_012:010 - In the wide signless ether of the Self, / In the unchanging Silence white and nude, / Aloof, resplendent like gold dazzling suns / Veiled by the Ray no mortal eye can bear, / The Spirit’s free and absolute potencies / Burn in the solitude of the thoughts of God.

01.04_012:011 - A rapture and a radiance and a hush / Delivered from the approach of wounded hearts, / Denied to the Idea that looks at grief, / Remote from the Force that cries out in its pain, / In his inalienable bliss they live.

01.04_012:012 - Immaculate in self-knowledge and self-power, / Calm they repose on the eternal Will.

01.04_012:013 - Only his law they count and him obey; / They have no goal to reach, no aim to serve.

01.04_012:014 - Implacable in their timeless purity, / All barter or bribe of worship they refuse; / Unmoved by cry of revolt and ignorant prayer / They reckon not our virtue and our sin, / They bend not to the voices that implore, / They hold no traffic with error and its reign: / They are guardians of the silence of the Truth, / They are keepers of the immutable decree.

01.04_012:015 - A deep surrender is their source of might, / A still identity their way to know, / Motionless is their action like a sleep. #divine-method

01.04_012:016 - At peace, regarding the trouble beneath the stars, / Deathless, watching the works of Death and Chance, / Immobile, seeing the millenniums pass, / Untouched while the long map of Fate unrolls, / They look on our struggle with impartial eyes, / And yet without them cosmos could not be.

01.04_012:017 - Impervious to desire and doom and hope, / Their station of inviolable might / Moveless upholds the world’s enormous task, / Its ignorance is by their knowledge lit, / Its yearning lasts by their indifference.

01.04_012:018 - As the height draws the low ever to climb, / As the breadths draw the small to adventure vast, / Their aloofness drives man to surpass himself.

01.04_012:019 - Our passion heaves to wed the eternal calm, / Our dwarf-search mind to meet the Omniscient’s force.

01.04_012:020 - Acquiescing in the wisdom that made hell / And the harsh utility of death and tears, / Acquiescing in the gradual steps of Time, / Careless they seem of the grief that stings the world’s heart, / Careless of the pain that rends its body and life; / Above joy and sorrow is that grandeur’s walk: / They have no portion in the good that dies, / Mute, pure, they share not in the evil done; / Else might their strength be marred and could not save.

01.04_012:021 - Alive to the truth that dwells in God’s extremes, / Awake to a motion of all-seeing Force, / The slow venture of the long ambiguous years / And the unexpected good from woeful deeds, / The immortal sees not as we vainly see.

01.04_012:022 - He looks on hidden aspects and screened powers, / He knows the law and natural line of things.

01.04_012:023 - Undriven by a brief life’s will to act, / Unharassed by the spur of pity and fear, / He makes no haste to untie the cosmic knot / Or the world’s torn jarring heart to reconcile.

01.04_012:024 - In Time he waits for the Eternal’s hour.

01.04_012:025 - Yet a spiritual secret aid is there; / While a tardy Evolution’s coils wind on / And Nature hews her way through adamant / A divine intervention thrones above.

01.04_012:026 - Alive in a dead rotating universe / We whirl not here upon a casual globe / Abandoned to a task beyond our force; / Even through the tangled anarchy called Fate / And through the bitterness of death and fall / An outstretched Hand is felt upon our lives.

01.04_012:027 - It is near us in unnumbered bodies and births; / In its unshaken grasp it keeps for us safe / The one inevitable supreme result / No will can take away and no doom change, / The crown of conscious Immortality, / The godhead promised to our struggling souls / When first man’s heart dared death and suffered life.

01.04_012:028t - One who has shaped this world is ever its lord: / Our errors are his steps upon the way; / He works through the fierce vicissitudes of our lives, / He works through the hard breath of battle and toil, / He works through our sins and sorrows and our tears, / His knowledge overrules our nescience; / Whatever the appearance we must bear, / Whatever our strong ills and present fate, / When nothing we can see but drift and bale, / A mighty Guidance leads us still through all. #all-is-yoga #divine-guidance #divine-leading #divine-means #faith #truth-of-divine-working #truth-of-things

01.04_012:029 - After we have served this great divided world / God’s bliss and oneness are our inborn right.

01.04_012:030 - A date is fixed in the calendar of the Unknown, / An anniversary of the Birth sublime: / Our soul shall justify its chequered walk, / All will come near that now is naught or far.

01.04_012:031 - These calm and distant Mights shall act at last.

01.04_012:032 - Immovably ready for their destined task, / The ever-wise compassionate Brilliances / Await the sound of the Incarnate’s voice / To leap and bridge the chasms of Ignorance / And heal the hollow yearning gulfs of Life / And fill the abyss that is the universe.

01.04_012:033 - Here meanwhile at the Spirit’s opposite pole / In the mystery of the deeps that God has built / For his abode below the Thinker’s sight, / In this compromise of a stark absolute Truth / With the Light that dwells near the dark end of things, / In this tragi-comedy of divine disguise, / This long far seeking for joy ever near, / In the grandiose dream of which the world is made, / In this gold dome on a black dragon base, / The conscious Force that acts in Nature’s breast, / A dark-robed labourer in the cosmic scheme / Carrying clay images of unborn gods, / Executrix of the inevitable Idea / Hampered, enveloped by the hoops of Fate, / Patient trustee of slow eternal Time, / Absolves from hour to hour her secret charge.

01.04_012:034 - All she foresees in masked imperative depths; / The dumb intention of the unconscious gulfs / Answers to a will that sees upon the heights, / And the evolving Word’s first syllable / Ponderous, brute-sensed, contains its luminous close, / Privy to a summit victory’s vast descent / And the portent of the soul’s immense uprise.


Section I - 13: seems its lonely self


01.04_013:001 - All here where each thing seems its lonely self / Are figures of the sole transcendent One: / Only by him they are, his breath is their life; / An unseen Presence moulds the oblivious clay.

01.04_013:002 - A playmate in the mighty Mother’s game, / One came upon the dubious whirling globe / To hide from her pursuit in force and form.

01.04_013:003 - A secret spirit in the Inconscient’s sleep, / A shapeless Energy, a voiceless Word, / He was here before the elements could emerge, / Before there was light of mind or life could breathe.

01.04_013:004 - Accomplice of her cosmic huge pretence, / His semblances he turns to real shapes / And makes the symbol equal with the truth: / He gives to his timeless thoughts a form in Time.

01.04_013:005 - He is the substance, he the self of things; / She has forged from him her works of skill and might: / She wraps him in the magic of her moods / And makes of his myriad truths her countless dreams.

01.04_013:006 - The Master of being has come close to her, / An immortal child born in the fugitive years.

01.04_013:007 - In objects wrought, in the persons she conceives, / Dreaming she chases her idea of him, / And catches here a look and there a gest: / Ever he repeats in them his ceaseless births.

01.04_013:008 - He is the Maker and the world he made, / He is the vision and he is the seer; / He is himself the actor and the act, / He is himself the knower and the known, / He is himself the dreamer and the dream.

01.04_013:009 - There are Two who are One and play in many worlds; / In Knowledge and Ignorance they have spoken and met / And light and darkness are their eyes’ interchange.

01.04_013:010 - Our pleasure and pain are their wrestle and embrace, / Our deeds, our hopes are intimate to their tale; / They are married secretly in our thought and life.

01.04_013:011 - The universe is an endless masquerade: / For nothing here is utterly what it seems, / It is a dream-fact vision of a truth / Which but for the dream would not be wholly true, / A phenomenon stands out significant / Against dim backgrounds of eternity; / We accept its face and pass by all it means; / A part is seen, we take it for the whole.

01.04_013:012 - Thus have they made their play with us for roles: / Author and actor with himself as scene, / He moves there as the Soul, as Nature she.

01.04_013:013 - Here on the earth where we must fill our parts, / We know not how shall run the drama’s course; / Our uttered sentences veil in their thought.

01.04_013:014 - Her mighty plan she holds back from our sight: / She has concealed her glory and her bliss / And disguised the Love and Wisdom in her heart.

01.04_013:015 - Of all the marvel and beauty that are hers / Only a darkened little we can feel.

01.04_013:016 - He too wears a diminished Godhead here, / He has forsaken his omnipotence, / His calm he has foregone and infinity.

01.04_013:017 - He knows her only, he has forgotten himself; / To her he abandons all to make her great.

01.04_013:018 - He hopes in her to find himself anew, / Incarnate, wedding his infinity’s peace / To her creative passion’s ecstasy.

01.04_013:019 - Although possessor of the earth and heavens, / He leaves to her the cosmic management / And watches all, the Witness of her scene.

01.04_013:020 - A supernumerary on her stage, / He speaks no words or hides behind the wings.

01.04_013:021 - He takes birth in her world, waits on her will, / Divines her enigmatic gesture’s sense, / The fluctuating chance turns of her mood, / Works out her meanings she seems not to know / And serves her secret purpose in long Time.

01.04_013:022 - As one too great for him he worships her; / He adores her as his regent of desire, / He yields to her as the mover of his will, / He burns the incense of his nights and days / Offering his life, a splendour of sacrifice.

01.04_013:023 - A rapt solicitor for her love and grace, / His bliss in her to him is his whole world: / He grows through her in all his being’s powers; / He reads by her God’s hidden aim in things.

01.04_013:024 - Or, a courtier in her countless retinue, / Content to be with her and feel her near / He makes the most of the little that she gives / And all she does drapes with his own delight.

01.04_013:025 - A glance can make his whole day wonderful, / A word from her lips with happiness wings the hours.

01.04_013:026 - He leans on her for all he does and is: / He builds on her largesses his proud fortunate days / And trails his peacock-plumaged joy of life / And suns in the glory of her passing smile.

01.04_013:027 - In a thousand ways he serves her royal needs; / He makes the hours pivot around her will, / Makes all reflect her whims; all is their play: / This whole wide world is only he and she.


Section I - 14: her mastering touch


01.04_014:001 - This is the knot that ties together the stars: / The Two who are one are the secret of all power, / The Two who are one are the might and right in things.

01.04_014:002 - His soul, silent, supports the world and her, / His acts are her commandment’s registers.

01.04_014:003 - Happy, inert he lies beneath her feet: / His breast he offers for her cosmic dance / Of which our lives are the quivering theatre, / And none could bear but for his strength within, / Yet none would leave because of his delight.

01.04_014:004 - His works, his thoughts have been devised by her, / His being is a mirror vast of hers: / Active, inspired by her he speaks and moves; / His deeds obey her heart’s unspoken demands: / Passive, he bears the impacts of the world / As if her touches shaping his soul and life: / His journey through the days is her sun-march; / He runs upon her roads; hers is his course.

01.04_014:005 - A witness and student of her joy and dole, / A partner in her evil and her good, / He has consented to her passionate ways, / He is driven by her sweet and dreadful force.

01.04_014:006 - His sanctioning name initials all her works; / His silence is his signature to her deeds; / In the execution of her drama’s scheme, / In her fancies of the moment and its mood, / In the march of this obvious ordinary world / Where all is deep and strange to the eyes that see / And Nature’s common forms are marvel-wefts, / She through his witness sight and motion of might / Unrolls the material of her cosmic Act, / Her happenings that exalt and smite the soul, / Her force that moves, her powers that save and slay, / Her Word that in the silence speaks to our hearts, / Her silence that transcends the summit Word, / Her heights and depths to which our spirit moves, / Her events that weave the texture of our lives / And all by which we find or lose ourselves, / Things sweet and bitter, magnificent and mean, / Things terrible and beautiful and divine.

01.04_014:007 - Her empire in the cosmos she has built, / He is governed by her subtle and mighty laws.

01.04_014:008 - His consciousness is a babe upon her knees, / Her endless space is the playground of his thoughts, / His being a field of her vast experiment; / She binds to knowledge of the shapes of Time / And the creative error of limiting mind / And chance that wears the rigid face of fate / And her sport of death and pain and Nescience, / His changed and struggling immortality.

01.04_014:009 - His soul is a subtle atom in a mass, / His substance a material for her works.

01.04_014:010 - His spirit survives amid the death of things, / He climbs to eternity through being’s gaps, / He is carried by her from Night to deathless Light.

01.04_014:011 - This grand surrender is his free-will’s gift, / His pure transcendent force submits to hers.

01.04_014:012 - In the mystery of her cosmic ignorance, / In the insoluble riddle of her play, / A creature made of perishable stuff, / In the pattern she has set for him he moves, / He thinks with her thoughts, with her trouble his bosom heaves; / He seems the thing that she would have him seem, / He is whatever her artist will can make.

01.04_014:013 - Although she drives him on her fancy’s roads, / At play with him as with her child or slave, / To freedom and the Eternal’s mastery / And immortality’s stand above the world, / She moves her seeming puppet of an hour.

01.04_014:014 - Even in his mortal session in body’s house / An aimless traveller between birth and death, / Ephemeral dreaming of immortality, / To reign she spurs him. He takes up her powers; / He has harnessed her to the yoke of her own law.

01.04_014:015 - His face of human thought puts on a crown.

01.04_014:016 - Held in her leash, bound to her veiled caprice, / He studies her ways if so he may prevail / Even for an hour and she work out his will; / He makes of her his moment passion’s serf: / To obey she feigns, she follows her creature’s lead: / For him she was made, lives only for his use.

01.04_014:017 - But conquering her, then is he most her slave; / He is her dependent, all his means are hers; / Nothing without her he can, she rules him still.

01.04_014:018 - At last he wakes to a memory of Self: / He sees within the face of deity, / The Godhead breaks out through the human mould: / Her highest heights she unmasks and is his mate.

01.04_014:019 - Till then he is a plaything in her game; / Her seeming regent, yet her fancy’s toy, / A living robot moved by her energy’s springs, / He acts as in the movements of a dream, / An automaton stepping in the grooves of Fate, / He stumbles on driven by her whip of Force: / His thought labours, a bullock in Time’s fields; / His will he thinks his own, is shaped in her forge.

01.04_014:020 - Obedient to World-Nature’s dumb control, / Driven by his own formidable Power, / His chosen partner in a titan game / Her will he has made the master of his fate, / Her whim the dispenser of his pleasure and pain; / He has sold himself into her regal power / For any blow or boon that she may choose: / Even in what is suffering to our sense, / He feels the sweetness of her mastering touch, / In all experience meets her blissful hands; / On his heart he bears the happiness of her tread / And the surprise of her arrival’s joy / In each event and every moment’s chance.

01.04_014:021 - All she can do is marvellous in his sight: / He revels in her, a swimmer in her sea, / A tireless amateur of her world-delight, / He rejoices in her every thought and act / And gives consent to all that she can wish; / Whatever she desires he wills to be: / The Spirit, the innumerable One / He has left behind his lone eternity, / He is an endless birth in endless Time, / Her finite’s multitude in an infinite space.


Section I - 15: the master of existence


01.04_015:001 - The master of existence lurks in us / And plays at hide and seek with his own Force; / In Nature’s instrument loiters secret God.

01.04_015:002 - The Immanent lives in man as in his house; / He has made the universe his pastime’s field, / A vast gymnasium of his works of might.

01.04_015:003 - All-knowing he accepts our darkened state, / Divine, wears shapes of animal or man; / Eternal, he assents to Fate and Time, / Immortal, dallies with mortality.

01.04_015:004 - The All-Conscious ventured into Ignorance, / The All-Blissful bore to be insensible.

01.04_015:005 - Incarnate in a world of strife and pain, / He puts on joy and sorrow like a robe / And drinks experience like a strengthening wine.

01.04_015:006 - He whose transcendence rules the pregnant Vasts, / Prescient now dwells in our subliminal depths, / A luminous individual Power, alone.

01.04_015:007 -     The Absolute, the Perfect, the Alone / Has called out of the Silence his mute Force / Where she lay in the featureless and formless hush / Guarding from Time by her immobile sleep / The ineffable puissance of his solitude.

01.04_015:008 - The Absolute, the Perfect, the Alone / Has entered with his silence into space: / He has fashioned these countless persons of one self; / He lives in all, who lived in his Vast alone; / Space is himself and Time is only he.

01.04_015:009 - The Absolute, the Perfect, the Immune, / One who is in us as our secret self, / Our mask of imperfection has assumed, / He has made this tenement of flesh his own, / His image in the human measure cast / That to his divine measure we might rise; / Then in a figure of divinity / The Maker shall recast us and impose / A plan of godhead on the mortal’s mould / Lifting our finite minds to his infinite, / Touching the moment with eternity.

01.04_015:010 - This transfiguration is earth’s due to heaven: / A mutual debt binds man to the Supreme: / His nature we must put on as he put ours; / We are sons of God and must be even as he: / His human portion, we must grow divine.

01.04_015:011 - Our life is a paradox with God for key.


Section I - 16: secret god


01.04_016:001 - But meanwhile all is a shadow cast by a dream / And to the musing and immobile Spirit / Life and himself don the aspect of a myth, / The burden of a long unmeaning tale.

01.04_016:002 - For the key is hid and by the Inconscient kept; / The secret God beneath the threshold dwells.

01.04_016:003 - In a body obscuring the immortal Spirit / A nameless Resident vesting unseen powers, / With Matter’s shapes and motives beyond thought / And the hazard of an unguessed consequence, / An omnipotent indiscernible Influence, / He sits, unfelt by the form in which he lives / And veils his knowledge by the groping mind.

01.04_016:004 - A wanderer in a world his thoughts have made, / He turns in a chiaroscuro of error and truth / To find a wisdom that on high is his.

01.04_016:005 - As one forgetting he searches for himself; / As if he had lost an inner light he seeks: / As a sojourner lingering amid alien scenes / He journeys to a home he knows no more.

01.04_016:006 - His own self’s truth he seeks who is the Truth; / He is the Player who became the play, / He is the Thinker who became the thought; / He is the many who was the silent One.

01.04_016:007 - In the symbol figures of the cosmic Force / And in her living and inanimate signs / And in her complex tracery of events / He explores the ceaseless miracle of himself, / Till the thousandfold enigma has been solved / In the single light of an all-witnessing Soul.

01.04_016:008 -     This was his compact with his mighty mate, / For love of her and joined to her for ever / To follow the course of Time’s eternity, / Amid magic dramas of her sudden moods / And the surprises of her masked Idea / And the vicissitudes of her vast caprice.

01.04_016:009 - Two seem his goals, yet ever are they one / And gaze at each other over bourneless Time; / Spirit and Matter are their end and source.

01.04_016:010 - A seeker of hidden meanings in life’s forms, / Of the great Mother’s wide uncharted will / And the rude enigma of her terrestrial ways / He is the explorer and the mariner / On a secret inner ocean without bourne: / He is the adventurer and cosmologist / Of a magic earth’s obscure geography.

01.04_016:011 - In her material order’s fixed design / Where all seems sure and even when changed, the same, / Even though the end is left for ever unknown / And ever unstable is life’s shifting flow, / His paths are found for him by silent fate; / As stations in the ages’ weltering flood / Firm lands appear that tempt and stay awhile, / Then new horizons lure the mind’s advance.

01.04_016:012 - There comes no close to the finite’s boundlessness, / There is no last certitude in which thought can pause / And no terminus of the soul’s experience.

01.04_016:013 - A limit, a farness never wholly reached, / An unattained perfection calls to him / From distant boundaries in the Unseen: / A long beginning only has been made.



Section I - 17: sailor on the flor of time


01.04_017:001 - This is the sailor on the flow of Time, / This is World-Matter’s slow discoverer, / Who, launched into this small corporeal birth, / Has learnt his craft in tiny bays of self, / But dares at last unplumbed infinitudes, / A voyager upon eternity’s seas.

01.04_017:002 - In his world-adventure’s crude initial start / Behold him ignorant of his godhead’s force, / Timid initiate of its vast design.

01.04_017:003 - An expert captain of a fragile craft, / A trafficker in small impermanent wares, / At first he hugs the shore and shuns the breadths, / Dares not to affront the far-off perilous main.

01.04_017:004 - He in a petty coastal traffic plies, / His pay doled out from port to neighbour port, / Content with his safe round’s unchanging course, / He hazards not the new and the unseen.

01.04_017:005 - But now he hears the sound of larger seas.

01.04_017:006 - A widening world calls him to distant scenes / And journeyings in a larger vision’s arc / And peoples unknown and still unvisited shores.

01.04_017:007 - On a commissioned keel his merchant hull / Serves the world’s commerce in the riches of Time / Severing the foam of a great land-locked sea / To reach unknown harbour lights in distant climes / And open markets for life’s opulent arts, / Rich bales, carved statuettes, hued canvases, / And jewelled toys brought for an infant’s play / And perishable products of hard toil / And transient splendours won and lost by the days.

01.04_017:008 - Or passing through a gate of pillar-rocks, / Venturing not yet to cross oceans unnamed / And journey into a dream of distances / He travels close to unfamiliar coasts / And finds new haven in storm-troubled isles, / Or, guided by a sure compass in his thought, / He plunges through a bright haze that hides the stars, / Steering on the trade-routes of Ignorance.

01.04_017:009 - His prow pushes towards undiscovered shores, / He chances on unimagined continents: / A seeker of the islands of the Blest, / He leaves the last lands, crosses the ultimate seas, / He turns to eternal things his symbol quest; / Life changes for him its time-constructed scenes, / Its images veiling infinity.

01.04_017:010 - Earth’s borders recede and the terrestrial air / Hangs round him no longer its translucent veil.

01.04_017:011 - He has crossed the limit of mortal thought and hope, / He has reached the world’s end and stares beyond; / The eyes of mortal body plunge their gaze / Into Eyes that look upon eternity.

01.04_017:012 - A greater world Time’s traveller must explore.

01.04_017:013 - At last he hears a chanting on the heights / And the far speaks and the unknown grows near: / He crosses the boundaries of the unseen / And passes over the edge of mortal sight / To a new vision of himself and things.

01.04_017:014 - He is a spirit in an unfinished world / That knows him not and cannot know itself: / The surface symbol of his goalless quest / Takes deeper meanings to his inner view; / His is a search of darkness for the light, / Of mortal life for immortality.

01.04_017:015 - In the vessel of an earthly embodiment / Over the narrow rails of limiting sense / He looks out on the magic waves of Time / Where mind like a moon illumines the world’s dark.

01.04_017:016 - There is limned ever retreating from the eyes, / As if in a tenuous misty dream-light drawn, / The outline of a dim mysterious shore.

01.04_017:017 - A sailor on the Inconscient’s fathomless sea, / He voyages through a starry world of thought / On Matter’s deck to a spiritual sun.

01.04_017:018 - Across the noise and multitudinous cry, / Across the rapt unknowable silences, / Through a strange mid-world under supernal skies, / Beyond earth’s longitudes and latitudes, / His goal is fixed outside all present maps.

01.04_017:019 - But none learns whither through the unknown he sails / Or what secret mission the great Mother gave.

01.04_017:020 - In the hidden strength of her omnipotent Will, / Driven by her breath across life’s tossing deep, / Through the thunder’s roar and through the windless hush, / Through fog and mist where nothing more is seen, / He carries her sealed orders in his breast.

01.04_017:021B - Late will he know, opening the mystic script, / Whether to a blank port in the Unseen / He goes, or armed with her fiat, to discover / A new mind and body in the city of God / And enshrine the Immortal in his glory’s house / And make the finite one with Infinity.

01.04_017:022 - Across the salt waste of the endless years / Her ocean winds impel his errant boat, / The cosmic waters plashing as he goes, / A rumour around him and danger and a call.

01.04_017:023 - Always he follows in her force’s wake.

01.04_017:024 - He sails through life and death and other life, / He travels on through waking and through sleep.

01.04_017:025 - A power is on him from her occult force / That ties him to his own creation’s fate, / And never can the mighty traveller rest / And never can the mystic voyage cease, / Till the nescient dusk is lifted from man’s soul / And the morns of God have overtaken his night.

01.04_017:026 - As long as Nature lasts, he too is there; / For this is sure that he and she are one.

01.04_017:027 - Even when he sleeps, he keeps her on his breast: / Whoever leaves her, he will not depart / To repose without her in the Unknowable.

01.04_017:028 - There is a truth to know, a work to do; / Her play is real; a Mystery he fulfils: / There is a plan in the Mother’s deep world-whim, / A purpose in her vast and random game.

01.04_017:029 - This ever she meant since the first dawn of life, / This constant will she covered with her sport, / To evoke a person in the impersonal Void, / With the Truth-Light strike earth’s massive roots of trance, / Wake a dumb self in the inconscient depths / And raise a lost power from its python sleep / That the eyes of the Timeless might look out from Time / And the world manifest the unveiled Divine.

01.04_017:030 - For this he left his white infinity / And laid on the Spirit the burden of the flesh, / That Godhead’s seed might flower in mindless Space.



Canto 5 - 1.5: The Yoga of the King: The Yoga of the Spirit's Freedom and Greatness


Section I - 18: the riddle grew plain


01.05_018:001 - This knowledge first he had of time-born men.

01.05_018:002 - Admitted through a curtain of bright mind / That hangs between our thought and absolute sight, / He found the occult cave, the mystic door / Near to the well of vision in the soul, / And entered where the Wings of Glory brood / In the sunlit space where all is for ever known.

01.05_018:003 - Indifferent to doubt and to belief, / Avid of the naked real’s single shock / He shore the cord of mind that ties the earth-heart / And cast away the yoke of Matter’s law.

01.05_018:004 - The body’s rules bound not the spirit’s powers: / When life had stopped its beats, death broke not in; / He dared to live when breath and thought were still.

01.05_018:005 - Thus could he step into that magic place / Which few can even glimpse with hurried glance / Lifted for a moment from mind’s laboured works / And the poverty of Nature’s earthly sight.

01.05_018:006 - All that the Gods have learned is there self-known.

01.05_018:007 - There in a hidden chamber closed and mute / Are kept the record graphs of the cosmic scribe, / And there the tables of the sacred Law, / There is the Book of Being’s index page, / The text and glossary of the Vedic truth / Are there; the rhythms and metres of the stars / Significant of the movements of our fate: / The symbol powers of number and of form, / And the secret code of the history of the world / And Nature’s correspondence with the soul / Are written in the mystic heart of life.

01.05_018:008 - In the glow of the Spirit’s room of memories / He could recover the luminous marginal notes / Dotting with light the crabbed ambiguous scroll, / Rescue the preamble and the saving clause / Of the dark Agreement by which all is ruled / That rises from material Nature’s sleep / To clothe the Everlasting in new shapes.

01.05_018:009 - He could re-read now and interpret new / Its strange symbol letters, scattered abstruse signs, / Resolve its oracle and its paradox, / Its riddling phrases and its blindfold terms, / The deep oxymoron of its truth’s repliques, / And recognise as a just necessity / Its hard conditions for the mighty work,— / Nature’s impossible Herculean toil / Only her warlock wisecraft could enforce, / Its law of opposition of the Gods, / Its list of inseparable contraries.

01.05_018:010 - The dumb great Mother in her cosmic trance / Exploiting for creation’s joy and pain / Infinity’s sanction to the birth of form, / Accepts indomitably to execute / The will to know in an inconscient world, / The will to live under a reign of death, / The thirst for rapture in a heart of flesh, / And works out through the appearance of a soul / By a miraculous birth in plasm and gas / The mystery of God’s covenant with the Night.

01.05_018:011 - Once more was heard in the still cosmic Mind / The Eternal’s promise to his labouring Force / Inducing the world-passion to begin, / The cry of birth into mortality / And the opening verse of the tragedy of Time.

01.05_018:012 - Out of the depths the world’s buried secret rose; / He read the original ukase kept back / In the locked archives of the spirit’s crypt, / And saw the signature and fiery seal / Of Wisdom on the dim Power’s hooded work / Who builds in Ignorance the steps of Light.

01.05_018:013 - A sleeping deity opened deathless eyes: / He saw the unshaped thought in soulless forms, / Knew Matter pregnant with spiritual sense, / Mind dare the study of the Unknowable, / Life its gestation of the Golden Child.

01.05_018:014 - In the light flooding thought’s blank vacancy, / Interpreting the universe by soul signs / He read from within the text of the without: / The riddle grew plain and lost its catch obscure.

01.05_018:015 - A larger lustre lit the mighty page.

01.05_018:016 - A purpose mingled with the whims of Time, / A meaning met the stumbling pace of Chance / And Fate revealed a chain of seeing will; / A conscious wideness filled the old dumb Space.

01.05_018:017 - In the Void he saw throned the Omniscience supreme.



Section I - 19: in symbols study reality


01.05_019:001 - A Will, a hope immense now seized his heart, / And to discern the superhuman’s form / He raised his eyes to unseen spiritual heights, / Aspiring to bring down a greater world.

01.05_019:002 - The glory he had glimpsed must be his home.

01.05_019:003 - A brighter heavenlier sun must soon illume / This dusk room with its dark internal stair, / The infant soul in its small nursery school / Mid objects meant for a lesson hardly learned / Outgrow its early grammar of intellect / And its imitation of Earth-Nature’s art, / Its earthly dialect to God-language change, / In living symbols study Reality / And learn the logic of the Infinite.

01.05_019:004 - The Ideal must be Nature’s common truth, / The body illumined with the indwelling God, / The heart and mind feel one with all that is, / A conscious soul live in a conscious world.

01.05_019:005 - As through a mist a sovereign peak is seen, / The greatness of the eternal Spirit appeared, / Exiled in a fragmented universe / Amid half-semblances of divine things.

01.05_019:006 - These now could serve no more his regal turn: / The Immortal’s pride refused the doom to live / A miser of the scanty bargain made / Between our littleness and bounded hopes / And the compassionate Infinitudes.

01.05_019:007 - His height repelled the lowness of earth’s state: / A wideness discontented with its frame / Resiled from poor assent to Nature’s terms, / The harsh contract spurned and the diminished lease.

01.05_019:008 - Only beginnings are accomplished here; / Our base’s Matter seems alone complete, / An absolute machine without a soul.

01.05_019:009 - Or all seems a misfit of half ideas, / Or we saddle with the vice of earthly form / A hurried imperfect glimpse of heavenly things, / Guesses and travesties of celestial types.

01.05_019:010 - Here chaos sorts itself into a world, / A brief formation drifting in the void: / Apings of knowledge, unfinished arcs of power, / Flamings of beauty into earthly shapes, / Love’s broken reflexes of unity / Swim, fragment mirrorings of a floating sun.

01.05_019:011 - A packed assemblage of crude tentative lives / Are pieced into a tessellated whole.

01.05_019:012 - There is no perfect answer to our hopes; / There are blind voiceless doors that have no key; / Thought climbs in vain and brings a borrowed light, / Cheated by counterfeits sold to us in life’s mart, / Our hearts clutch at a forfeited heavenly bliss.

01.05_019:013 - There is provender for the mind’s satiety, / There are thrills of the flesh, but not the soul’s desire.

01.05_019:014 - Here even the highest rapture Time can give / Is a mimicry of ungrasped beatitudes, / A mutilated statue of ecstasy, / A wounded happiness that cannot live, / A brief felicity of mind or sense / Thrown by the World-Power to her body-slave, / Or a simulacrum of enforced delight / In the seraglios of Ignorance.

01.05_019:015 - For all we have acquired soon loses worth, / An old disvalued credit in Time’s bank, / Imperfection’s cheque drawn on the Inconscient.

01.05_019:016 - An inconsequence dogs every effort made, / And chaos waits on every cosmos formed: / In each success a seed of failure lurks.

01.05_019:017 - He saw the doubtfulness of all things here, / The incertitude of man’s proud confident thought, / The transience of the achievements of his force.

01.05_019:018 - A thinking being in an unthinking world, / An island in the sea of the Unknown, / He is a smallness trying to be great, / An animal with some instincts of a god, / His life a story too common to be told, / His deeds a number summing up to nought, / His consciousness a torch lit to be quenched, / His hope a star above a cradle and grave.

01.05_019:019 - And yet a greater destiny may be his, / For the eternal Spirit is his truth.

01.05_019:020 - He can re-create himself and all around / And fashion new the world in which he lives: / He, ignorant, is the Knower beyond Time, / He is the Self above Nature, above Fate.



Section I - 20: a hope immense


01.05_020:001 - His soul retired from all that he had done.

01.05_020:002 - Hushed was the futile din of human toil, / Forsaken wheeled the circle of the days; / In distance sank the crowded tramp of life.

01.05_020:003 - The Silence was his sole companion left.

01.05_020:004 - Impassive he lived immune from earthly hopes, / A figure in the ineffable Witness’ shrine / Pacing the vast cathedral of his thoughts / Under its arches dim with infinity / And heavenward brooding of invisible wings.

01.05_020:005 - A call was on him from intangible heights; / Indifferent to the little outpost Mind, / He dwelt in the wideness of the Eternal’s reign.

01.05_020:006 - His being now exceeded thinkable Space, / His boundless thought was neighbour to cosmic sight: / A universal light was in his eyes, / A golden influx flowed through heart and brain; / A force came down into his mortal limbs, / A current from eternal seas of Bliss; / He felt the invasion and the nameless joy.

01.05_020:007 - Aware of his occult omnipotent Source, / Allured by the omniscient Ecstasy, / A living centre of the Illimitable / Widened to equate with the world’s circumference, / He turned to his immense spiritual fate.

01.05_020:008 - Abandoned on a canvas of torn air, / A picture lost in far and fading streaks, / The earth-nature’s summits sank below his feet: / He climbed to meet the infinite more above.

01.05_020:009 - The Immobile’s ocean-silence saw him pass, / An arrow leaping through eternity / Suddenly shot from the tense bow of Time, / A ray returning to its parent sun.

01.05_020:010 - Opponent of that glory of escape, / The black Inconscient swung its dragon tail / Lashing a slumberous Infinite by its force / Into the deep obscurities of form: / Death lay beneath him like a gate of sleep.

01.05_020:011 - One-pointed to the immaculate Delight, / Questing for God as for a splendid prey, / He mounted burning like a cone of fire.

01.05_020:012 - To a few is given that godlike rare release.

01.05_020:013 - One among many thousands never touched, / Engrossed in the external world’s design, / Is chosen by a secret witness Eye / And driven by a pointing hand of Light / Across his soul’s unmapped immensitudes.

01.05_020:014 - A pilgrim of the everlasting Truth, / Our measures cannot hold his measureless mind; / He has turned from the voices of the narrow realm / And left the little lane of human Time.

01.05_020:015 - In the hushed precincts of a vaster plan / He treads the vestibules of the Unseen, / Or listens following a bodiless Guide / To a lonely cry in boundless vacancy.

01.05_020:016 - All the deep cosmic murmur falling still, / He lives in the hush before the world was born, / His soul left naked to the timeless One.

01.05_020:017 - Far from compulsion of created things / Thought and its shadowy idols disappear, / The moulds of form and person are undone.

01.05_020:018 - The ineffable Wideness knows him for its own.

01.05_020:019 - A lone forerunner of the Godward earth, / Among the symbols of yet unshaped things / Watched by closed eyes, mute faces of the Unborn, / He journeys to meet the Incommunicable, / Hearing the echo of his single steps / In the eternal courts of Solitude.

01.05_020:020 - A nameless Marvel fills the motionless hours.

01.05_020:021 - His spirit mingles with Eternity’s heart / And bears the silence of the Infinite.



Section I - 21: consumed the limitations


01.05_021:001 - In a divine retreat from mortal thought, / In a prodigious gesture of soul-sight, / His being towered into pathless heights, / Naked of its vesture of humanity.

01.05_021:002 - As thus it rose, to meet him bare and pure / A strong Descent leaped down. A Might, a Flame, / A Beauty half-visible with deathless eyes, / A violent Ecstasy, a Sweetness dire, / Enveloped him with its stupendous limbs / And penetrated nerve and heart and brain / That thrilled and fainted with the epiphany: / His nature shuddered in the Unknown’s grasp.

01.05_021:003 - In a moment shorter than Death, longer than Time, / By a power more ruthless than Love, happier than Heaven, / Taken sovereignly into eternal arms, / Haled and coerced by a stark absolute bliss, / In a whirlwind circuit of delight and force / Hurried into unimaginable depths, / Upborne into immeasurable heights, / It was torn out from its mortality / And underwent a new and bourneless change.

01.05_021:004 - An Omniscient knowing without sight or thought, / An indecipherable Omnipotence, / A mystic Form that could contain the worlds, / Yet make one human breast its passionate shrine, / Drew him out of his seeking loneliness / Into the magnitudes of God’s embrace.

01.05_021:005 - As when a timeless Eye annuls the hours / Abolishing the agent and the act, / So now his spirit shone out wide, blank, pure: / His wakened mind became an empty slate / On which the Universal and Sole could write.

01.05_021:006 - All that represses our fallen consciousness / Was taken from him like a forgotten load: / A fire that seemed the body of a god / Consumed the limiting figures of the past / And made large room for a new self to live.

01.05_021:007 - Eternity’s contact broke the moulds of sense.

01.05_021:008 - A greater force than the earthly held his limbs, / Huge workings bared his undiscovered sheaths, / Strange energies wrought and screened tremendous hands, / Unwound the triple cord of mind and freed / The heavenly wideness of a Godhead’s gaze.

01.05_021:009 - As through a dress the wearer’s shape is seen, / There reached through forms to the hidden absolute / A cosmic feeling and transcendent sight.

01.05_021:010 - Increased and heightened were the instruments.

01.05_021:011 - Illusion lost her aggrandising lens; / As from her failing hand the measures fell, / Atomic looked the things that loomed so large.

01.05_021:012 - The little ego’s ring could join no more; / In the enormous spaces of the self / The body now seemed only a wandering shell, / His mind the many-frescoed outer court / Of an imperishable Inhabitant: / His spirit breathed a superhuman air.

01.05_021:013 - The imprisoned deity rent its magic fence / As with a sound of thunder and of seas, / Vast barriers crashed around the huge escape.

01.05_021:014 - Immutably coeval with the world, / Circle and end of every hope and toil / Inexorably drawn round thought and act, / The fixed immovable peripheries / Effaced themselves beneath the Incarnate’s tread.

01.05_021:015 - The dire velamen and the bottomless crypt / Between which life and thought for ever move, / Forbidden still to cross the dim dread bounds, / The guardian darknesses mute and formidable, / Empowered to circumscribe the wingless spirit / In the boundaries of Mind and Ignorance, / Protecting no more a dual eternity / Vanished rescinding their enormous role: / Once figure of creation’s vain ellipse, / The expanding zero lost its giant curve.

01.05_021:016 - The old adamantine vetoes stood no more: / Overpowered were earth and Nature’s obsolete rule; / The python coils of the restricting Law / Could not restrain the swift arisen God: / Abolished were the scripts of destiny.

01.05_021:017 - There was no small death-hunted creature more, / No fragile form of being to preserve / From an all-swallowing Immensity.

01.05_021:018 - The great hammer-beats of a pent-up world-heart / Burst open the narrow dams that keep us safe / Against the forces of the universe.

01.05_021:019 - The soul and cosmos faced as equal powers.

01.05_021:020 - A boundless being in a measureless Time / Invaded Nature with the infinite; / He saw unpathed, unwalled his titan scope.



Section I - 22: turned against the evil


01.05_022:001 - All was uncovered to his sealless eye.

01.05_022:002 - A secret Nature stripped of her defence, / Once in a dreaded half-light formidable, / Overtaken in her mighty privacy / Lay bare to the burning splendour of his will.

01.05_022:003 - In shadowy chambers lit by a strange sun / And opening hardly to hid mystic keys / Her perilous arcanes and hooded Powers / Confessed the advent of a mastering Mind / And bore the compulsion of a time-born gaze.

01.05_022:004 - Incalculable in their wizard modes, / Immediate and invincible in the act, / Her secret strengths native to greater worlds / Lifted above our needy limited scope, / The occult privilege of demigods / And the sure power-pattern of her cryptic signs, / Her diagrams of geometric force, / Her potencies of marvel-fraught design / Courted employment by an earth-nursed might.

01.05_022:005 - A conscious Nature’s quick machinery / Armed with a latent splendour of miracle / The prophet-passion of a seeing Mind, / And the lightning bareness of a free soul-force.

01.05_022:006 - All once impossible deemed could now become / A natural limb of possibility, / A new domain of normalcy supreme.

01.05_022:007 - An almighty occultist erects in space / This seeming outward world which tricks the sense; / He weaves his hidden threads of consciousness, / He builds bodies for his shapeless energy; / Out of the unformed and vacant Vast he has made / His sorcery of solid images, / His magic of formative number and design, / The fixed irrational links none can annul, / This criss-cross tangle of invisible laws; / His infallible rules, his covered processes, / Achieve unerringly an inexplicable / Creation where our error carves dead frames / Of knowledge for a living ignorance.

01.05_022:008 - In her mystery’s moods divorced from the Maker’s laws / She too as sovereignly creates her field, / Her will shaping the undetermined vasts, / Making a finite of infinity; / She too can make an order of her caprice, / As if her rash superb wagered to outvie / The veiled Creator’s cosmic secrecies.

01.05_022:009 - The rapid footsteps of her phantasy, / Amid whose falls wonders like flowers rise, / Are surer than reason, defter than device / And swifter than Imagination’s wings.

01.05_022:010 - All she new-fashions by the thought and word / Compels all substance by her wand of Mind.

01.05_022:011 - Mind is a mediator divinity: / Its powers can undo all Nature’s work: / Mind can suspend or change earth’s concrete law.

01.05_022:012 - Affranchised from earth-habit’s drowsy seal / The leaden grip of Matter it can break; / Indifferent to the angry stare of Death, / It can immortalise a moment’s work: / A simple fiat of its thinking force, / The casual pressure of its slight assent / Can liberate the Energy dumb and pent / Within its chambers of mysterious trance: / It makes the body’s sleep a puissant arm, / Holds still the breath, the beatings of the heart, / While the unseen is found, the impossible done, / Communicates without means the unspoken thought; / It moves events by its bare silent will, / Acts at a distance without hands or feet.

01.05_022:013 - This giant Ignorance, this dwarfish Life / It can illumine with a prophet sight, / Invoke the bacchic rapture, the Fury’s goad, / In our body arouse the demon or the god, / Call in the Omniscient and Omnipotent, / Awake a forgotten Almightiness within.

01.05_022:014 - In its own plane a shining emperor, / Even in this rigid realm, Mind can be king: / The logic of its demigod Idea, / In the leap of a transitional moment brings / Surprises of creation never achieved / Even by Matter’s strange unconscious skill.

01.05_022:015 - All’s miracle here and can by miracle change.

01.05_022:016 - This is that secret Nature’s edge of might.

01.05_022:017 - On the margin of great immaterial planes, / In kingdoms of an untrammelled glory of force, / Where Mind is master of the life and form / And soul fulfils its thoughts by its own power, / She meditates upon mighty words and looks / On the unseen links that join the parted spheres.

01.05_022:018 - Thence to the initiate who observes her laws / She brings the light of her mysterious realms: / Here where he stands, his feet on a prostrate world, / His mind no more cast into Matter’s mould, / Over their bounds in spurts of splendid strength / She carries their magician processes / And the formulas of their stupendous speech, / Till heaven and hell become purveyors to earth / And the universe the slave of mortal will.

01.05_022:019 - A mediatrix with veiled and nameless gods / Whose alien will touches our human life, / Imitating the World-Magician’s ways / She invents for her self-bound free will its grooves / And feigns for magic’s freaks a binding cause.

01.05_022:020 - All worlds she makes the partners of her deeds, / Accomplices of her mighty violence, / Her daring leaps into the impossible: / From every source she has taken her cunning means, / She draws from the free-love marriage of the planes / Elements for her creation’s tour-de-force: / A wonder-weft of knowledge incalculable, / A compendium of divine invention’s feats / She has combined to make the unreal true / Or liberate suppressed reality: / In her unhedged Circean wonderland / Pell-mell she shepherds her occult mightinesses; / Her mnemonics of the craft of the Infinite, / Jets of the screened subliminal’s caprice, / Tags of the gramarye of Inconscience, / Freedom of a sovereign Truth without a law, / Thoughts that were born in the immortals’ world, / Oracles that break out from behind the shrine, / Warnings from the daemonic inner voice / And peeps and lightning-leaps of prophecy / And intimations to the inner ear, / Abrupt interventions stark and absolute / And the superconscient’s unaccountable acts, / Have woven her balanced web of miracles / And the weird technique of her tremendous art.

01.05_022:021 - This bizarre kingdom passed into his charge.

01.05_022:022 - As one resisting more the more she loves, / Her great possessions and her power and law / She gave, compelled, with a reluctant joy; / Herself she gave for rapture and for use.

01.05_022:023 - Absolved from aberrations in deep ways, / The ends she recovered for which she was made: / She turned against the evil she had helped / Her engined wrath, her invisible means to slay; / Her dangerous moods and arbitrary force / She surrendered to the service of the soul / And the control of a spiritual will.

01.05_022:024 - A greater despot tamed her despotism.

01.05_022:025 - Assailed, surprised in the fortress of her self, / Conquered by her own unexpected King, / Fulfilled and ransomed by her servitude, / She yielded in a vanquished ecstasy, / Her sealed hieratic wisdom forced from her, / Fragments of the mystery of omnipotence.


Section I - 23: magic porch


01.05_023:001 - A border sovereign is the occult Force.

01.05_023:002 - A threshold guardian of the earth-scene’s Beyond, / She has canalised the outbreaks of the Gods / And cut through vistas of intuitive sight / A long road of shimmering discoveries.

01.05_023:003 - The worlds of a marvellous Unknown were near, / Behind her an ineffable Presence stood: / Her reign received their mystic influences, / Their lion-forces crouched beneath her feet; / The future sleeps unknown behind their doors.

01.05_023:004 - Abysms infernal gaped round the soul’s steps / And called to its mounting vision peaks divine: / An endless climb and adventure of the Idea / There tirelessly tempted the explorer mind.

01.05_023:005 - And countless voices visited the charmed ear; / A million figures passed and were seen no more.

01.05_023:006 - This was a forefront of God’s thousandfold house, / Beginnings of the half-screened Invisible.

01.05_023:007 - A magic porch of entry glimmering / Quivered in a penumbra of screened Light, / A court of the mystical traffic of the worlds, / A balcony and miraculous façade.

01.05_023:008 - Above her lightened high immensities; / All the unknown looked out from boundlessness: / It lodged upon an edge of hourless Time, / Gazing out of some everlasting Now, / Its shadows gleaming with the birth of gods, / Its bodies signalling the Bodiless, / Its foreheads glowing with the Oversoul, / Its forms projected from the Unknowable, / Its eyes dreaming of the Ineffable, / Its faces staring into eternity.

01.05_023:009 - Life in him learned its huge subconscient rear; / The little fronts unlocked to the unseen Vasts: / Her gulfs stood nude, her far transcendences / Flamed in transparencies of crowded light.


Section I - 24: map of subtle signs


01.05_024:001 - A giant order was discovered here / Of which the tassel and extended fringe / Are the scant stuff of our material lives.

01.05_024:002 - This overt universe whose figures hide / The secrets merged in superconscient light, / Wrote clear the letters of its glowing code: / A map of subtle signs surpassing thought / Was hung upon a wall of inmost mind.

01.05_024:003 - Illumining the world’s concrete images / Into significant symbols by its gloss, / It offered to the intuitive exegete / Its reflex of the eternal Mystery.

01.05_024:004 - Ascending and descending twixt life’s poles / The serried kingdoms of the graded Law / Plunged from the Everlasting into Time, / Then glad of a glory of multitudinous mind / And rich with life’s adventure and delight / And packed with the beauty of Matter’s shapes and hues / Climbed back from Time into undying Self, / Up a golden ladder carrying the Soul, / Tying with diamond threads the Spirit’s extremes.

01.05_024:005 - In this drop from consciousness to consciousness / Each leaned on the occult Inconscient’s power, / The fountain of its needed Ignorance, / Archmason of the limits by which it lives.

01.05_024:006 - In this soar from consciousness to consciousness / Each lifted tops to That from which it came, / Origin of all that it had ever been / And home of all that it could still become.

01.05_024:007 - An organ scale of the Eternal’s acts, / Mounting to their climax in an endless Calm, / Paces of the many-visaged Wonderful, / Predestined stadia of the evolving Way, / Measures of the stature of the growing soul, / They interpreted existence to itself / And, mediating twixt the heights and deeps, / United the veiled married opposites / And linked creation to the Ineffable.

01.05_024:008 - A last high world was seen where all worlds meet; / In its summit gleam where Night is not nor Sleep, / The light began of the Trinity supreme.

01.05_024:009 - All there discovered what it seeks for here.

01.05_024:010 - It freed the finite into boundlessness / And rose into its own eternities.

01.05_024:011 - The Inconscient found its heart of consciousness, / The idea and feeling groping in Ignorance / At last clutched passionately the body of Truth, / The music born in Matter’s silences / Plucked nude out of the Ineffable’s fathomlessness / The meaning it had held but could not voice; / The perfect rhythm now only sometimes dreamed / An answer brought to the torn earth’s hungry need / Rending the night that had concealed the Unknown, / Giving to her her lost forgotten soul.

01.05_024:012 - A grand solution closed the long impasse / In which the heights of mortal effort end.

01.05_024:013 - A reconciling Wisdom looked on life; / It took the striving undertones of mind / And took the confused refrain of human hopes / And made of them a sweet and happy call: / It lifted from an underground of pain / The inarticulate murmur of our lives / And found for it a sense illimitable.

01.05_024:014 - A mighty oneness its perpetual theme, / It caught the soul’s faint scattered utterances, / Read hardly twixt our lines of rigid thought / Or mid this drowse and coma on Matter’s breast / Heard like disjointed mutterings in sleep; / It grouped the golden links that they had lost / And showed to them their divine unity, / Saving from the error of divided self / The deep spiritual cry in all that is.

01.05_024:015 - All the great Words that toiled to express the One / Were lifted into an absoluteness of light, / An ever-burning Revelation’s fire / And the immortality of the eternal Voice.

01.05_024:016 - There was no quarrel more of truth with truth; / The endless chapter of their differences / Retold in light by an omniscient Scribe, / Travelled through difference towards unity, / Mind’s winding search lost every tinge of doubt / Led to its end by an all-seeing speech / That garbed the initial and original thought / With the finality of an ultimate phrase: / United were Time’s creative mood and tense / To the style and syntax of Identity.

01.05_024:017 - A paean swelled from the lost musing deeps; / An anthem pealed to the triune ecstasies, / A cry of the moments to the Immortal’s bliss.

01.05_024:018 - As if the strophes of a cosmic ode, / A hierarchy of climbing harmonies / Peopled with voices and with visages / Aspired in a crescendo of the Gods / From Matter’s abysses to the Spirit’s peaks.

01.05_024:019 - Above were the Immortal’s changeless seats, / White chambers of dalliance with Eternity / And the stupendous gates of the Alone.

01.05_024:020 - Across the unfolding of the seas of self / Appeared the deathless countries of the One.

01.05_024:021 - A many-miracled consciousness unrolled / Vast aim and process and unfettered norms, / A larger Nature’s great familiar roads.

01.05_024:022 - Affranchised from the net of earthly sense / Calm continents of potency were glimpsed; / Homelands of beauty shut to human eyes, / Half-seen at first through wonder’s gleaming lids, / Surprised the vision with felicity; / Sunbelts of knowledge, moonbelts of delight / Stretched out in an ecstasy of widenesses / Beyond our indigent corporeal range.

01.05_024:023 - There he could enter, there awhile abide.

01.05_024:024 - A voyager upon uncharted routes / Fronting the viewless danger of the Unknown / Adventuring across enormous realms, / He broke into another Space and Time.

01.05_024:999 - end of book one


Canto Book2 - 2: THE BOOK OF THE TRAVELLER OF THE WORLDS

Canto 1 - 2.1: The World-Stair

Section 25 - 25: universe of the unknown


02.01_025:001 - Alone he moved watched by the infinity / Around him and the Unknowable above.

02.01_025:002 - All could be seen that shuns the mortal eye, / All could be known the mind has never grasped; / All could be done no mortal will can dare.

02.01_025:003 - A limitless movement filled a limitless peace.

02.01_025:004 - In a profound existence beyond earth’s / Parent or kin to our ideas and dreams / Where Space is a vast experiment of the soul, / In a deep oneness of all things that are, / The universe of the Unknown arose.

02.01_025:005 - A self-creation without end or pause / Revealed the grandeurs of the Infinite: / It flung into the hazards of its play / A million moods, a myriad energies, / The world-shapes that are fancies of its Truth / And the formulas of the freedom of its Force.

02.01_025:006 - It poured into the Ever-stable’s flux / A bacchic rapture and revel of Ideas, / A passion and motion of everlastingness.

02.01_025:007 - There rose unborn into the Unchanging’s surge / Thoughts that abide in their deathless consequence, / Words that immortal last though fallen mute, / Acts that brought out from Silence its dumb sense, / Lines that convey the inexpressible.

02.01_025:008 - The Eternal’s stillness saw in unmoved joy / His universal Power at work display / In plots of pain and dramas of delight / The wonder and beauty of her will to be.

02.01_025:009 - All, even pain, was the soul’s pleasure here; / Here all experience was a single plan, / The thousandfold expression of the One.

02.01_025:010 - All came at once into his single view; / Nothing escaped his vast intuitive sight, / Nothing drew near he could not feel as kin: / He was one spirit with that immensity.

02.01_025:011 - Images in a supernal consciousness / Embodying the Unborn who never dies, / The structured visions of the cosmic Self / Alive with the touch of being’s eternity / Looked at him like form-bound spiritual thoughts / Figuring the movements of the Ineffable.

02.01_025:012 - Aspects of being donned world-outline; forms / That open moving doors on things divine, / Became familiar to his hourly sight; / The symbols of the Spirit’s reality, / The living bodies of the Bodiless / Grew near to him, his daily associates.

02.01_025:013 - The exhaustless seeings of the unsleeping Mind, / Letterings of its contact with the invisible, / Surrounded him with countless pointing signs; / The voices of a thousand realms of Life / Missioned to him her mighty messages.

02.01_025:014 - The heaven-hints that invade our earthly lives, / The dire imaginations dreamed by Hell, / Which if enacted and experienced here / Our dulled capacity soon would cease to feel / Or our mortal frailty could not long endure, / Were set in their sublime proportions there.

02.01_025:015 - There lived out in their self-born atmosphere, / They resumed their topless pitch and native power; / Their fortifying stress upon the soul / Bit deep into the ground of consciousness / The passion and purity of their extremes, / The absoluteness of their single cry / And the sovereign sweetness or violent poetry / Of their beautiful or terrible delight.

02.01_025:016 - All thought can know or widest sight perceive / And all that thought and sight can never know, / All things occult and rare, remote and strange / Were near to heart’s contact, felt by spirit-sense.

02.01_025:017 - Asking for entry at his nature’s gates / They crowded the widened spaces of his mind, / His self-discovery’s flaming witnesses, / Offering their marvel and their multitude.

02.01_025:018 - These now became new portions of himself, / The figures of his spirit’s greater life, / The moving scenery of his large time-walk / Or the embroidered tissue of his sense: / These took the place of intimate human things / And moved as close companions of his thoughts, / Or were his soul’s natural environment.

02.01_025:019 - Tireless the heart’s adventure of delight, / Endless the kingdoms of the Spirit’s bliss, / Unnumbered tones struck from one harmony’s strings; / Each to its wide-winged universal poise, / Its fathomless feeling of the All in one, / Brought notes of some perfection yet unseen, / Its single retreat into Truth’s secrecies, / Its happy sidelight on the Infinite.

02.01_025:020 - All was found there the Unique had dreamed and made / Tinging with ceaseless rapture and surprise / And an opulent beauty of passionate difference / The recurring beat that moments God in Time.

02.01_025:021 - Only was missing the sole timeless Word / That carries eternity in its lonely sound, / The Idea self-luminous key to all ideas, / The integer of the Spirit’s perfect sum / That equates the unequal All to the equal One, / The single sign interpreting every sign, / The absolute index to the Absolute.


Section I - 26: temple-tower to heaven


02.01_026:001 - There walled apart by its own innerness / In a mystical barrage of dynamic light / He saw a lone immense high-curved world-pile / Erect like a mountain chariot of the Gods / Motionless under an inscrutable sky.

02.01_026:002 - As if from Matter’s plinth and viewless base / To a top as viewless, a carved sea of worlds / Climbing with foam-maned waves to the Supreme / Ascended towards breadths immeasurable; / It hoped to soar into the Ineffable’s reign: / A hundred levels raised it to the Unknown.

02.01_026:003 - So it towered up to heights intangible / And disappeared in the hushed conscious Vast / As climbs a storeyed temple-tower to heaven / Built by the aspiring soul of man to live / Near to his dream of the Invisible.

02.01_026:004 - Infinity calls to it as it dreams and climbs; / Its spire touches the apex of the world; / Mounting into great voiceless stillnesses / It marries the earth to screened eternities.

02.01_026:005 - Amid the many systems of the One / Made by an interpreting creative joy / Alone it points us to our journey back / Out of our long self-loss in Nature’s deeps; / Planted on earth it holds in it all realms: / It is a brief compendium of the Vast.

02.01_026:006 - This was the single stair to being’s goal.

02.01_026:007 - A summary of the stages of the spirit, / Its copy of the cosmic hierarchies / Refashioned in our secret air of self / A subtle pattern of the universe.

02.01_026:008 - It is within, below, without, above.

02.01_026:009 - Acting upon this visible Nature’s scheme / It wakens our earth-matter’s heavy doze / To think and feel and to react to joy; / It models in us our diviner parts, / Lifts mortal mind into a greater air, / Makes yearn this life of flesh to intangible aims, / Links the body’s death with immortality’s call: / Out of the swoon of the Inconscience / It labours towards a superconscient Light.

02.01_026:010 - If earth were all and this were not in her, / Thought could not be nor life-delight’s response: / Only material forms could then be her guests / Driven by an inanimate world-force.

02.01_026:011 - Earth by this golden superfluity / Bore thinking man and more than man shall bear; / This higher scheme of being is our cause / And holds the key to our ascending fate; / It calls out of our dense mortality / The conscious spirit nursed in Matter’s house.

02.01_026:012 - The living symbol of these conscious planes, / Its influences and godheads of the unseen, / Its unthought logic of Reality’s acts / Arisen from the unspoken truth in things, / Have fixed our inner life’s slow-scaled degrees.

02.01_026:013 - Its steps are paces of the soul’s return / From the deep adventure of material birth, / A ladder of delivering ascent / And rungs that Nature climbs to deity.

02.01_026:014 - Once in the vigil of a deathless gaze / These grades had marked her giant downward plunge, / The wide and prone leap of a godhead’s fall.

02.01_026:015 - Our life is a holocaust of the Supreme.

02.01_026:016 - The great World-Mother by her sacrifice / Has made her soul the body of our state; / Accepting sorrow and unconsciousness / Divinity’s lapse from its own splendours wove / The many-patterned ground of all we are.

02.01_026:017 - An idol of self is our mortality.

02.01_026:018 - Our earth is a fragment and a residue; / Her power is packed with the stuff of greater worlds / And steeped in their colour-lustres dimmed by her drowse; / An atavism of higher births is hers, / Her sleep is stirred by their buried memories / Recalling the lost spheres from which they fell.

02.01_026:019 - Unsatisfied forces in her bosom move; / They are partners of her greater growing fate / And her return to immortality; / They consent to share her doom of birth and death; / They kindle partial gleams of the All and drive / Her blind laborious spirit to compose / A meagre image of the mighty Whole.

02.01_026:020 - The calm and luminous Intimacy within / Approves her work and guides the unseeing Power.

02.01_026:021 - His vast design accepts a puny start.

02.01_026:022 - An attempt, a drawing half-done is the world’s life; / Its lines doubt their concealed significance, / Its curves join not their high-intended close.

02.01_026:023 - Yet some first image of greatness trembles there, / And when the ambiguous crowded parts have met / The many-toned unity to which they moved, / The Artist’s joy shall laugh at reason’s rules; / The divine intention suddenly shall be seen, / The end vindicate intuition’s sure technique.

02.01_026:024 - A graph shall be of many meeting worlds, / A cube and union crystal of the gods; / A Mind shall think behind Nature’s mindless mask, / A conscious Vast fill the old dumb brute Space.

02.01_026:025 - This faint and fluid sketch of soul called man / Shall stand out on the background of long Time / A glowing epitome of eternity, / A little point reveal the infinitudes.

02.01_026:026 - A Mystery’s process is the universe.

02.01_026:027 - At first was laid a strange anomalous base, / A void, a cipher of some secret Whole, / Where zero held infinity in its sum / And All and Nothing were a single term, / An eternal negative, a matrix Nought: / Into its forms the Child is ever born / Who lives for ever in the vasts of God.

02.01_026:028 - A slow reversal’s movement then took place: / A gas belched out from some invisible Fire, / Of its dense rings were formed these million stars; / Upon earth’s new-born soil God’s tread was heard.

02.01_026:029 - Across the thick smoke of earth’s ignorance / A Mind began to see and look at forms / And groped for knowledge in the nescient Night: / Caught in a blind stone-grip Force worked its plan / And made in sleep this huge mechanical world, / That Matter might grow conscious of its soul / And like a busy midwife the life-power / Deliver the zero carrier of the All.

02.01_026:030 - Because eternal eyes turned on earth’s gulfs / The lucent clarity of a pure regard / And saw a shadow of the Unknowable / Mirrored in the Inconscient’s boundless sleep, / Creation’s search for self began its stir.

02.01_026:031 - A spirit dreamed in the crude cosmic whirl, / Mind flowed unknowing in the sap of life / And Matter’s breasts suckled the divine Idea.

02.01_026:032 - A miracle of the Absolute was born, / Infinity put on a finite soul, / All ocean lived within a wandering drop, / A time-made body housed the Illimitable.

02.01_026:033 - To live this Mystery out our souls came here.


Section I - 27: heaven after heaven


02.01_027:001 - A Seer within who knows the ordered plan / Concealed behind our momentary steps, / Inspires our ascent to viewless heights / As once the abysmal leap to birth and life.

02.01_027:002 - His call had reached the Traveller in Time.

02.01_027:003 - Apart in an unfathomed loneliness, / He travelled in his mute and single strength / Bearing the burden of the world’s desire.

02.01_027:004 - A formless Stillness called, a nameless Light.

02.01_027:005 - Above him was the white immobile Ray, / Around him the eternal Silences.

02.01_027:006t - No term was fixed to the high-pitched attempt; / World after world disclosed its guarded powers, / Heaven after heaven its deep beatitudes, / But still the invisible Magnet drew his soul. #divine-aim #divine-beauty #divine-leading #endless-goal #god #infinite-perfection #siddhi #soul #treasures-of-the-spirit

02.01_027:007 - A figure sole on Nature’s giant stair, / He mounted towards an indiscernible end / On the bare summit of created things.



Canto 2 - 2.2: The Kingdom of Subtle Matter

Section I - 28: kingdoms of ideal sight


02.02_028:001 - In the impalpable field of secret self, / This little outer being’s vast support / Parted from vision by earth’s solid fence, / He came into a magic crystal air / And found a life that lived not by the flesh, / A light that made visible immaterial things.

02.02_028:002 - A fine degree in wonder’s hierarchy, / The kingdom of subtle Matter’s faery craft / Outlined against a sky of vivid hues, / Leaping out of a splendour-trance and haze, / The wizard revelation of its front.

02.02_028:003 - A world of lovelier forms lies near to ours, / Where, undisguised by earth’s deforming sight, / All shapes are beautiful and all things true.

02.02_028:004 - In that lucent ambiance mystically clear / The eyes were doors to a celestial sense, / Hearing was music and the touch a charm / And the heart drew a deeper breath of power.

02.02_028:005 - There dwell earth-nature’s shining origins: / The perfect plans on which she moulds her works, / The distant outcomes of her travailing force / Repose in a framework of established fate.

02.02_028:006 - Attempted vainly now or won in vain, / Already were mapped and scheduled there the time / And the figure of her future sovereignties / In the sumptuous lineaments traced by desire.

02.02_028:007 - The golden issue of mind’s labyrinth plots, / The riches unfound or still uncaught by our lives / Unsullied by the attaint of mortal thought / Abide in that pellucid atmosphere.

02.02_028:008 - Our vague beginnings are overtaken there, / Our middle terms sketched out in prescient lines, / Our finished ends anticipated live.

02.02_028:009 - This brilliant roof of our descending plane, / Intercepting the free boon of heaven’s air, / Admits small inrushes of a mighty breath / Or fragrant circuits through gold lattices; / It shields our ceiling of terrestrial mind / From deathless suns and the streaming of God’s rain, / Yet canalises a strange irised glow, / And bright dews drip from the Immortal’s sky.

02.02_028:010 - A passage for the Powers that move our days, / Occult behind this grosser Nature’s walls, / A gossamer marriage-hall of Mind with Form / Is hidden by a tapestry of dreams; / Heaven’s meanings steal through it as through a veil, / Its inner sight sustains this outer scene.

02.02_028:011 - A finer consciousness with happier lines, / It has a tact our touch cannot attain, / A purity of sense we never feel; / Its intercession with the eternal Ray / Inspires our transient earth’s brief-lived attempts / At beauty and the perfect shape of things.

02.02_028:012 - In rooms of the young divinity of power / And early play of the eternal Child / The embodiments of his outwinging thoughts / Laved in a bright everlasting wonder’s tints / And lulled by whispers of that lucid air / Take dream-hued rest like birds on timeless trees / Before they dive to float on earth-time’s sea.

02.02_028:013 - All that here seems has lovelier semblance there.

02.02_028:014 - Whatever our hearts conceive, our heads create, / Some high original beauty forfeiting, / Thence exiled here consents to an earthly tinge.

02.02_028:015 - Whatever is here of visible charm and grace / Finds there its faultless and immortal lines; / All that is beautiful here is there divine.

02.02_028:016 - Figures are there undreamed by mortal mind: / Bodies that have no earthly counterpart / Traverse the inner eye’s illumined trance / And ravish the heart with their celestial tread / Persuading heaven to inhabit that wonder sphere.

02.02_028:017 - The future’s marvels wander in its gulfs; / Things old and new are fashioned in those depths: / A carnival of beauty crowds the heights / In that magic kingdom of ideal sight.

02.02_028:018 - In its antechambers of splendid privacy / Matter and soul in conscious union meet / Like lovers in a lonely secret place: / In the clasp of a passion not yet unfortunate / They join their strength and sweetness and delight / And mingling make the high and low worlds one.

02.02_028:019 - Intruder from the formless Infinite / Daring to break into the Inconscient’s reign, / The spirit’s leap towards body touches ground.

02.02_028:020 - As yet unwrapped in earthly lineaments, / Already it wears outlasting death and birth, / Convincing the abyss by heavenly form, / A covering of its immortality / Alive to the lustre of the wearer’s rank, / Fit to endure the rub of Change and Time.

02.02_028:021 - A tissue mixed of the soul’s radiant light / And Matter’s substance of sign-burdened Force,— / Imagined vainly in our mind’s thin air / An abstract phantasm mould of mental make,— / It feels what earthly bodies cannot feel / And is more real than this grosser frame.

02.02_028:022 - After the falling of mortality’s cloak / Lightened is its weight to heighten its ascent; / Refined to the touch of finer environments / It drops old patterned palls of denser stuff, / Cancels the grip of earth’s descending pull / And bears the soul from world to higher world, / Till in the naked ether of the peaks / The spirit simplicity alone is left, / The eternal being’s first transparent robe.

02.02_028:023 - But when it must come back to its mortal load / And the hard ensemble of earth’s experience, / Then its return resumes that heavier dress.

02.02_028:024 - For long before earth’s solid vest was forged / By the technique of the atomic Void, / A lucent envelope of self-disguise / Was woven round the secret spirit in things.

02.02_028:025 - The subtle realms from those bright sheaths are made.

02.02_028:026 - This wonder-world with all its radiant boon / Of vision and inviolate happiness, / Only for expression cares and perfect form; / Fair on its peaks, it has dangerous nether planes; / Its light draws towards the verge of Nature’s lapse; / It lends beauty to the terror of the gulfs / And fascinating eyes to perilous Gods, / Invests with grace the demon and the snake.

02.02_028:027 - Its trance imposes earth’s inconscience, / Immortal it weaves for us death’s sombre robe / And authorises our mortality.

02.02_028:028 - This medium serves a greater Consciousness: / A vessel of its concealed autocracy, / It is the subtle ground of Matter’s worlds, / It is the immutable in their mutable forms, / In the folds of its creative memory / It guards the deathless type of perishing things: / Its lowered potencies found our fallen strengths; / Its thought invents our reasoned ignorance; / Its sense fathers our body’s reflexes.

02.02_028:029 - Our secret breath of untried mightier force, / The lurking sun of an instant’s inner sight, / Its fine suggestions are a covert fount / For our iridescent rich imaginings / Touching things common with transfiguring hues / Till even earth’s mud grows rich and warm with the skies / And a glory gleams from the soul’s decadence.

02.02_028:030 - Its knowledge is our error’s starting-point; / Its beauty dons our mud-mask ugliness, / Its artist good begins our evil’s tale.

02.02_028:031 - A heaven of creative truths above, / A cosmos of harmonious dreams between, / A chaos of dissolving forms below, / It plunges lost in our inconscient base.

02.02_028:032 - Out of its fall our denser Matter came.



Section I - 29: Gods plundge into the Night


02.02_029:001 - Thus taken was God’s plunge into the Night.

02.02_029:002 - This fallen world became a nurse of souls / Inhabited by concealed divinity.

02.02_029:003 - A Being woke and lived in the meaningless void, / A world-wide Nescience strove towards life and thought, / A Consciousness plucked out from mindless sleep.

02.02_029:004 - All here is driven by an insentient will.

02.02_029:005 - Thus fallen, inconscient, frustrate, dense, inert, / Sunk into inanimate and torpid drowse / Earth lay, a drudge of sleep, forced to create / By a subconscient yearning memory / Left from a happiness dead before she was born, / An alien wonder on her senseless breast.

02.02_029:006 - This mire must harbour the orchid and the rose, / From her blind unwilling substance must emerge / A beauty that belongs to happier spheres.

02.02_029:007 - This is the destiny bequeathed to her, / As if a slain god left a golden trust / To a blind force and an imprisoned soul.

02.02_029:008 - An immortal godhead’s perishable parts / She must reconstitute from fragments lost, / Re-word from a document complete elsewhere / Her doubtful title to her divine Name.

02.02_029:009 - A residue her sole inheritance, / All things she carries in her shapeless dust.

02.02_029:010 - Her giant energy tied to petty forms / In the slow tentative motion of her power / With only frail blunt instruments for use, / She has accepted as her nature’s need / And given to man as his stupendous work / A labour to the gods impossible.

02.02_029:011 - A life living hardly in a field of death / Its portion claims of immortality; / A brute half-conscious body serves as means / A mind that must recover a knowledge lost / Held in stone-grip by the world’s inconscience, / And wearing still these countless knots of Law / A spirit bound stand up as Nature’s king.



Section I - 30: figure of eternity arrive


02.02_030:001 - A mighty kinship is this daring’s cause.

02.02_030:002 - All we attempt in this imperfect world, / Looks forward or looks back beyond Time’s gloss / To its pure idea and firm inviolate type / In an absolute creation’s flawless skill.

02.02_030:003 - To seize the absolute in shapes that pass, / To feel the eternal’s touch in time-made things, / This is the law of all perfection here.

02.02_030:004 - A fragment here is caught of heaven’s design; / Else could we never hope for greater life / And ecstasy and glory could not be.

02.02_030:005 - Even in the littleness of our mortal state, / Even in this prison-house of outer form, / A brilliant passage for the infallible Flame / Is driven through gross walls of nerve and brain, / A Splendour presses or a Power breaks through, / Earth’s great dull barrier is removed awhile, / The inconscient seal is lifted from our eyes / And we grow vessels of creative might.

02.02_030:006 - The enthusiasm of a divine surprise / Pervades our life, a mystic stir is felt, / A joyful anguish trembles in our limbs; / A dream of beauty dances through the heart, / A thought from the eternal Mind draws near, / Intimations cast from the Invisible / Awaking from Infinity’s sleep come down, / Symbols of That which never yet was made.

02.02_030:007 - But soon the inert flesh responds no more, / Then sinks the sacred orgy of delight, / The blaze of passion and the tide of power / Are taken from us and, though a glowing form / Abides astonishing earth, imagined supreme, / Too little of what was meant has left a trace.

02.02_030:008 - Earth’s eyes half see, her forces half create; / Her rarest works are copies of heaven’s art.

02.02_030:009 - A radiance of a golden artifice, / A masterpiece of inspired device and rule, / Her forms hide what they house and only mime / The unseized miracle of self-born shapes / That live for ever in the Eternal’s gaze.

02.02_030:010 - Here in a difficult half-finished world / Is a slow toiling of unconscious Powers; / Here is man’s ignorant divining mind, / His genius born from an inconscient soil.

02.02_030:011 - To copy on earth’s copies is his art.

02.02_030:012 - For when he strives for things surpassing earth, / Too rude the workman’s tools, too crude his stuff, / And hardly with his heart’s blood he achieves / His transient house of the divine Idea, / His figure of a Time-inn for the Unborn.

02.02_030:013 - Our being thrills with high far memories / And would bring down their dateless meanings here, / But, too divine for earthly Nature’s scheme, / Beyond our reach the eternal marvels blaze.

02.02_030:014 - Absolute they dwell, unborn, immutable, / Immaculate in the Spirit’s deathless air, / Immortal in a world of motionless Time / And an unchanging muse of deep self-space.

02.02_030:015 - Only when we have climbed above ourselves, / A line of the Transcendent meets our road / And joins us to the timeless and the true; / It brings to us the inevitable word, / The godlike act, the thoughts that never die.

02.02_030:016 - A ripple of light and glory wraps the brain, / And travelling down the moment’s vanishing route / The figures of eternity arrive.

02.02_030:017 - As the mind’s visitors or the heart’s guests / They espouse our mortal brevity awhile, / Or seldom in some rare delivering glimpse / Are caught by our vision’s delicate surmise.

02.02_030:018 - Although beginnings only and first attempts, / These glimmerings point to the secret of our birth / And the hidden miracle of our destiny.

02.02_030:019 - What we are there and here on earth shall be / Is imaged in a contact and a call.

02.02_030:020 - As yet earth’s imperfection is our sphere, / Our nature’s glass shows not our real self; / That greatness still abides held back within.

02.02_030:021 - Earth’s doubting future hides our heritage: / The Light now distant shall grow native here, / The Strength that visits us our comrade power; / The Ineffable shall find a secret voice, / The Imperishable burn through Matter’s screen / Making this mortal body godhead’s robe.

02.02_030:022 - The Spirit’s greatness is our timeless source / And it shall be our crown in endless Time.

02.02_030:023 - A vast Unknown is round us and within; / All things are wrapped in the dynamic One: / A subtle link of union joins all life.

02.02_030:024 - Thus all creation is a single chain: / We are not left alone in a closed scheme / Between a driving of inconscient Force / And an incommunicable Absolute.

02.02_030:025 - Our life is a spur in a sublime soul-range, / Our being looks beyond its walls of mind / And it communicates with greater worlds; / There are brighter earths and wider heavens than ours.

02.02_030:026 - There are realms where Being broods in its own depths; / It feels in its immense dynamic core / Its nameless, unformed, unborn potencies / Cry for expression in the unshaped Vast: / Ineffable beyond Ignorance and death, / The images of its ever-living Truth / Look out from a chamber of its self-rapt soul: / As if to its own inner witness gaze / The Spirit holds up its mirrored self and works, / The power and passion of its timeless heart, / The figures of its formless ecstasy, / The grandeurs of its multitudinous might.

02.02_030:027 - Thence comes the mystic substance of our souls / Into the prodigy of our nature’s birth, / There is the unfallen height of all we are / And dateless fount of all we hope to be.

02.02_030:028 - On every plane the hieratic Power, / Initiate of the unspoken verities, / Dreams to transcribe and make a part of life / In its own native style and living tongue / Some trait of the perfection of the Unborn, / Some vision seen in the omniscient Light, / Some far tune of the immortal rhapsodist Voice, / Some rapture of the all-creating Bliss, / Some form and plan of the Beauty unutterable.

02.02_030:029 - Worlds are there nearer to those absolute realms, / Where the response to Truth is swift and sure / And spirit is not hampered by its frame / And hearts by sharp division seized and rent / And delight and beauty are inhabitants / And love and sweetness are the law of life.

02.02_030:030 - A finer substance in a subtler mould / Embodies the divinity earth but dreams; / Its strength can overtake joy’s running feet; / Overleaping the fixed hurdles set by Time, / The rapid net of an intuitive clasp / Captures the fugitive happiness we desire.

02.02_030:031 - A Nature lifted by a larger breath, / Plastic and passive to the all-shaping Fire, / Answers the flaming Godhead’s casual touch: / Immune from our inertia of response / It hears the word to which our hearts are deaf, / Adopts the seeing of immortal eyes / And, traveller on the roads of line and hue, / Pursues the spirit of beauty to its home.

02.02_030:032 - Thus we draw near to the All-Wonderful / Following his rapture in things as sign and guide; / Beauty is his footprint showing us where he has passed, / Love is his heartbeats’ rhythm in mortal breasts, / Happiness the smile on his adorable face.

02.02_030:033 - A communion of spiritual entities, / A genius of creative Immanence, / Makes all creation deeply intimate: / A fourth dimension of aesthetic sense / Where all is in ourselves, ourselves in all, / To the cosmic wideness re-aligns our souls.

02.02_030:034 - A kindling rapture joins the seer and seen; / The craftsman and the craft grown inly one / Achieve perfection by the magic throb / And passion of their close identity.

02.02_030:035 - All that we slowly piece from gathered parts, / Or by long labour stumblingly evolve, / Is there self-born by its eternal right.

02.02_030:036 - In us too the intuitive Fire can burn; / An agent Light, it is coiled in our folded hearts, / On the celestial levels is its home: / Descending, it can bring those heavens here.

02.02_030:037 - But rarely burns the flame nor burns for long, / The joy it calls from those diviner heights / Brings brief magnificent reminiscences / And high splendid glimpses of interpreting thought, / But not the utter vision and delight.

02.02_030:038 - A veil is kept, something is still held back, / Lest, captives of the beauty and the joy, / Our souls forget to the Highest to aspire.


Section I - 31: a magic circle


02.02_031:001 - In that fair subtle realm behind our own / The form is all and physical gods are kings.

02.02_031:002 - The inspiring Light plays in fine boundaries; / A faultless beauty comes by Nature’s grace; / There liberty is perfection’s guarantee: / Although the absolute Image lacks, the Word / Incarnate, the sheer spiritual ecstasy, / All is a miracle of symmetric charm, / A fantasy of perfect line and rule.

02.02_031:003 - There all feel satisfied in themselves and whole, / A rich completeness is by limit made, / Marvel in an utter littleness abounds, / An intricate rapture riots in a small space: / Each rhythm is kin to its environment, / Each line is perfect and inevitable, / Each object faultlessly built for charm and use.

02.02_031:004 - All is enamoured of its own delight.

02.02_031:005 - Intact it lives of its perfection sure / In a heaven-pleased self-glad immunity; / Content to be, it has need of nothing more.

02.02_031:006 - Here was not futile effort’s broken heart: / Exempt from the ordeal and the test, / Empty of opposition and of pain, / It was a world that could not fear nor grieve.

02.02_031:007 - It had no grace of error or defeat, / It had no room for fault, no power to fail.

02.02_031:008 - Out of some packed self-bliss it drew at once / Its form-discoveries of the mute Idea / And the miracle of its rhythmic thoughts and acts, / Its clear technique of firm and rounded lives, / Its gracious people of inanimate shapes / And glory of breathing bodies like our own.

02.02_031:009 - Amazed, his senses ravished with delight, / He moved in a divine, yet kindred world / Admiring marvellous forms so near to ours / Yet perfect like the playthings of a god, / Deathless in the aspect of mortality.

02.02_031:010 - In their narrow and exclusive absolutes / The finite’s ranked supremacies throned abide; / It dreams not ever of what might have been; / Only in boundaries can this absolute live.

02.02_031:011 - In a supremeness bound to its own plan / Where all was finished and no widths were left, / No space for shadows of the immeasurable, / No room for the incalculable’s surprise, / A captive of its own beauty and ecstasy, / In a magic circle wrought the enchanted Might.

02.02_031:012 - The spirit stood back effaced behind its frame.

02.02_031:013 - Admired for the bright finality of its lines / A blue horizon limited the soul; / Thought moved in luminous facilities, / The outer ideal’s shallows its swim-range: / Life in its boundaries lingered satisfied / With the small happiness of the body’s acts.

02.02_031:014 - Assigned as Force to a bound corner Mind, / Attached to the safe paucity of her room, / She did her little works and played and slept / And thought not of a greater work undone.

02.02_031:015 - Forgetful of her violent vast desires, / Forgetful of the heights to which she rose, / Her walk was fixed within a radiant groove.

02.02_031:016 - The beautiful body of a soul at ease, / Like one who laughs in sweet and sunlit groves, / Childlike she swung in her gold cradle of joy.

02.02_031:017 - The spaces’ call reached not her charmed abode, / She had no wings for wide and dangerous flight, / She faced no peril of sky or of abyss, / She knew no vistas and no mighty dreams, / No yearning for her lost infinitudes.

02.02_031:018 - A perfect picture in a perfect frame, / This faery artistry could not keep his will: / Only a moment’s fine release it gave; / A careless hour was spent in a slight bliss.

02.02_031:019 - Our spirit tires of being’s surfaces, / Transcended is the splendour of the form; / It turns to hidden powers and deeper states.

02.02_031:020 - So now he looked beyond for greater light.

02.02_031:021 - His soul’s peak-climb abandoning in its rear / This brilliant courtyard of the House of Days, / He left that fine material Paradise.

02.02_031:022 - His destiny lay beyond in larger Space.


Canto 3 - 2.3: The Glory and Fall of Life

Section I - 32: passion of the infinite


02.03_032:001 - An uneven broad ascent now lured his feet.

02.03_032:002 - Answering a greater Nature’s troubled call / He crossed the limits of embodied Mind / And entered wide obscure disputed fields / Where all was doubt and change and nothing sure, / A world of search and toil without repose.

02.03_032:003 - As one who meets the face of the Unknown, / A questioner with none to give reply, / Attracted to a problem never solved, / Always uncertain of the ground he trod, / Always drawn on to an inconstant goal / He travelled through a land peopled by doubts / In shifting confines on a quaking base.

02.03_032:004 - In front he saw a boundary ever unreached / And thought himself at each step nearer now,— / A far retreating horizon of mirage.

02.03_032:005 - A vagrancy was there that brooked no home, / A journey of countless paths without a close.

02.03_032:006 - Nothing he found to satisfy his heart; / A tireless wandering sought and could not cease.

02.03_032:007 - There life is the manifest incalculable, / A movement of unquiet seas, a long / And venturesome leap of spirit into Space, / A vexed disturbance in the eternal Calm, / An impulse and passion of the Infinite.

02.03_032:008 - Assuming whatever shape her fancy wills, / Escaped from the restraint of settled forms / She has left the safety of the tried and known.

02.03_032:009 - Unshepherded by the fear that walks through Time, / Undaunted by Fate that dogs and Chance that springs, / She accepts disaster as a common risk; / Careless of suffering, heedless of sin and fall, / She wrestles with danger and discovery / In the unexplored expanses of the Soul.

02.03_032:010 - To be seemed only a long experiment, / The hazard of a seeking ignorant Force / That tries all truths and, finding none supreme, / Moves on unsatisfied, unsure of its end.

02.03_032:011 - As saw some inner mind, so life was shaped: / From thought to thought she passed, from phase to phase, / Tortured by her own powers or proud and blest, / Now master of herself, now toy and slave.

02.03_032:012 - A huge inconsequence was her action’s law, / As if all possibility must be drained / And anguish and bliss were pastimes of the heart.

02.03_032:013 - In a gallop of thunder-hooved vicissitudes / She swept through the race-fields of Circumstance, / Or, swaying, she tossed between her heights and deeps, / Uplifted or broken on Time’s incessant wheel.

02.03_032:014 - Amid a tedious crawl of drab desires / She writhed, a worm mid worms in Nature’s mud, / Then, Titan-statured, took all earth for food, / Ambitioned the seas for robe, for crown the stars / And shouting strode from peak to giant peak, / Clamouring for worlds to conquer and to rule.

02.03_032:015 - Then wantonly enamoured of Sorrow’s face, / She plunged into the anguish of the depths / And, wallowing, clung to her own misery.

02.03_032:016 - In dolorous converse with her squandered self / She wrote the account of all that she had lost, / Or sat with grief as with an ancient friend.

02.03_032:017 - A romp of violent raptures soon was spent, / Or she lingered tied to an inadequate joy / Missing the turns of fate, missing life’s goal.

02.03_032:018 - A scene was planned for all her numberless moods / Where each could be the law and way of life, / But none could offer a pure felicity; / Only a flickering zest they left behind / Or the fierce lust that brings a dead fatigue.

02.03_032:019 - Amid her swift untold variety / Something remained dissatisfied ever the same / And in the new saw only a face of the old, / For every hour repeated all the rest / And every change prolonged the same unease.

02.03_032:020 - A spirit of her self and aim unsure, / Tired soon of too much joy and happiness, / She needs the spur of pleasure and of pain / And the native taste of suffering and unrest: / She strains for an end that never can she win.

02.03_032:021 - A perverse savour haunts her thirsting lips: / For the grief she weeps which came from her own choice, / For the pleasure yearns that racked with wounds her breast; / Aspiring to heaven she turns her steps towards hell.

02.03_032:022 - Chance she has chosen and danger for playfellows; / Fate’s dreadful swing she has taken for cradle and seat.

02.03_032:023 - Yet pure and bright from the Timeless was her birth, / A lost world-rapture lingers in her eyes, / Her moods are faces of the Infinite: / Beauty and happiness are her native right, / And endless bliss is her eternal home.


Section I - 33: kingdoms of griefless life


02.03_033:001 - This now revealed its antique face of joy, / A sudden disclosure to the heart of grief / Tempting it to endure and long and hope.

02.03_033:002 - Even in changing worlds bereft of peace, / In an air racked with sorrow and with fear / And while his feet trod on a soil unsafe, / He saw the image of a happier state.

02.03_033:003 - In an architecture of hieratic Space / Circling and mounting towards creation’s tops, / At a blue height which never was too high / For warm communion between body and soul, / As far as heaven, as near as thought and hope, / Glimmered the kingdom of a griefless life.

02.03_033:004 - Above him in a new celestial vault / Other than the heavens beheld by mortal eyes, / As on a fretted ceiling of the gods, / An archipelago of laughter and fire, / Swam stars apart in a rippled sea of sky.

02.03_033:005 - Towered spirals, magic rings of vivid hue / And gleaming spheres of strange felicity / Floated through distance like a symbol world.

02.03_033:006 - On the trouble and the toil they could not share, / On the unhappiness they could not aid, / Impervious to life’s suffering, struggle, grief, / Untarnished by its anger, gloom and hate, / Unmoved, untouched, looked down great visioned planes / Blissful for ever in their timeless right.

02.03_033:007 - Absorbed in their own beauty and content, / Of their immortal gladness they live sure.

02.03_033:008 - Apart in their self-glory plunged, remote / Burning they swam in a vague lucent haze, / An everlasting refuge of dream-light, / A nebula of the splendours of the gods / Made from the musings of eternity.

02.03_033:009 - Almost unbelievable by human faith, / Hardly they seemed the stuff of things that are.

02.03_033:010 - As through a magic television’s glass / Outlined to some magnifying inner eye / They shone like images thrown from a far scene / Too high and glad for mortal lids to seize.

02.03_033:011 - But near and real to the longing heart / And to the body’s passionate thought and sense / Are the hidden kingdoms of beatitude.

02.03_033:012 - In some close unattained realm which yet we feel, / Immune from the harsh clutch of Death and Time, / Escaping the search of sorrow and desire, / In bright enchanted safe peripheries / For ever wallowing in bliss they lie.

02.03_033:013 - In dream and trance and muse before our eyes, / Across a subtle vision’s inner field, / Wide rapturous landscapes fleeting from the sight, / The figures of the perfect kingdom pass / And behind them leave a shining memory’s trail.

02.03_033:014 - Imagined scenes or great eternal worlds, / Dream-caught or sensed, they touch our hearts with their depths; / Unreal-seeming yet more real than life, / Happier than happiness, truer than things true / If dreams these were or captured images, / Dream’s truth made false earth’s vain realities.

02.03_033:015 - In a swift eternal moment fixed there live / Or ever recalled come back to longing eyes / Calm heavens of imperishable Light, / Illumined continents of violet peace, / Oceans and rivers of the mirth of God / And griefless countries under purple suns.


Section I - 34: dream-truth


02.03_034:001 - This, once a star of bright remote idea / Or imagination’s comet trail of dream, / Took now a close shape of reality.

02.03_034:002 - The gulf between dream-truth, earth-fact was crossed, / The wonder-worlds of life were dreams no more; / His vision made all they unveiled its own: / Their scenes, their happenings met his eyes and heart / And smote them with pure loveliness and bliss.

02.03_034:003 - A breathless summit region drew his gaze / Whose boundaries jutted into a sky of Self / And dipped towards a strange ethereal base.

02.03_034:004 - The quintessence glowed of Life’s supreme delight.

02.03_034:005 - On a spiritual and mysterious peak / Only a miracle’s high transfiguring line / Divided life from the formless Infinite / And sheltered Time against eternity.

02.03_034:006 - Out of that formless stuff Time mints his shapes; / The Eternal’s quiet holds the cosmic act: / The protean images of the World-Force / Have drawn the strength to be, the will to last / From a deep ocean of dynamic peace.

02.03_034:007 - Inverting the Spirit’s apex towards life / She spends the plastic liberties of the One / To cast in acts the dreams of her caprice, / His wisdom’s call steadies her careless feet, / He props her dance upon a rigid base, / His timeless still immutability / Must standardise her creation’s miracle.

02.03_034:008 - Out of the Void’s unseeing energies / Inventing the scene of a concrete universe, / By his thought she has fixed its paces, in its blind acts / She sees by flashes of his all-knowing Light.

02.03_034:009 - At her will the inscrutable Supermind leans down / To guide her force that feels but cannot know, / Its breadth of power controls her restless seas / And life obeys the governing Idea.

02.03_034:010 - At her will, led by a luminous Immanence / The hazardous experimenting Mind / Pushes its way through obscure possibles / Mid chance formations of an unknowing world.

02.03_034:011 - Our human ignorance moves towards the Truth / That Nescience may become omniscient: / Transmuted instincts shape to divine thoughts, / Thoughts house infallible immortal sight / And Nature climbs towards God’s identity.

02.03_034:012 - The Master of the worlds self-made her slave / Is the executor of her fantasies: / She has canalised the seas of omnipotence; / She has limited by her laws the Illimitable.

02.03_034:013 - The Immortal bound himself to do her works; / He labours at the tasks her Ignorance sets, / Hidden in the cape of our mortality.

02.03_034:014 - The worlds, the forms her goddess fancy makes / Have lost their origin on unseen heights: / Even severed, straying from their timeless source, / Even deformed, obscured, accursed and fallen,— / Since even fall has its perverted joy / And nothing she leaves out that serves delight,— / These too can to the peaks revert or here / Cut out the sentence of the spirit’s fall, / Recover their forfeited divinity.

02.03_034:015 - At once caught in an eternal vision’s sweep / He saw her pride and splendour of highborn zones / And her regions crouching in the nether deeps.

02.03_034:016 - Above was a monarchy of unfallen self, / Beneath was the gloomy trance of the abyss, / An opposite pole or dim antipodes.

02.03_034:017 - There were vasts of the glory of life’s absolutes: / All laughed in a safe immortality / And an eternal childhood of the soul / Before darkness came and pain and grief were born / Where all could dare to be themselves and one / And Wisdom played in sinless innocence / With naked Freedom in Truth’s happy sun.

02.03_034:018 - There were worlds of her laughter and dreadful irony, / There were fields of her taste of toil and strife and tears; / Her head lay on the breast of amorous Death, / Sleep imitated awhile extinction’s peace.

02.03_034:019 - The light of God she has parted from his dark / To test the savour of bare opposites.

02.03_034:020 - Here mingling in man’s heart their tones and hues / Have woven his being’s mutable design, / His life a forward-rippling stream in Time, / His nature’s constant fixed mobility, / His soul a moving picture’s changeful film, / His cosmos-chaos of personality.

02.03_034:021 - The grand creatrix with her cryptic touch / Has turned to pathos and power being’s self-dream, / Made a passion-play of its fathomless mystery.


Section I - 35: half-way to heaven


02.03_035:001 - But here were worlds lifted half-way to heaven.

02.03_035:002 - The Veil was there but not the Shadowy Wall; / In forms not too remote from human grasp / Some passion of the inviolate purity / Broke through, a ray of the original Bliss.

02.03_035:003 - Heaven’s joys might have been earth’s if earth were pure.

02.03_035:004 - There could have reached our divinised sense and heart / Some natural felicity’s bright extreme, / Some thrill of supernature’s absolutes: / All strengths could laugh and sport on earth’s hard roads / And never feel her cruel edge of pain, / All love could play and nowhere Nature’s shame.

02.03_035:005 - But she has stabled her dreams in Matter’s courts / And still her doors are barred to things supreme.

02.03_035:006 - These worlds could feel God’s breath visiting their tops; / Some glimmer of the Transcendent’s hem was there.

02.03_035:007 - Across the white aeonic silences / Immortal figures of embodied joy / Traversed wide spaces near to eternity’s sleep.

02.03_035:008 - Pure mystic voices in beatitude’s hush / Appealed to Love’s immaculate sweetnesses, / Calling his honeyed touch to thrill the worlds, / His blissful hands to seize on Nature’s limbs, / His sweet intolerant might of union / To take all beings into his saviour arms, / Drawing to his pity the rebel and the waif / To force on them the happiness they refuse.

02.03_035:009 - A chant hymeneal to the unseen Divine, / A flaming rhapsody of white desire / Lured an immortal music into the heart / And woke the slumbering ear of ecstasy.

02.03_035:010 - A purer, fierier sense had there its home, / A burning urge no earthly limbs can hold.

02.03_035:011 - One drew a large unburdened spacious breath / And the heart sped from beat to rapturous beat.

02.03_035:012 - The voice of time sang of the Immortal’s joy; / An inspiration and a lyric cry, / The moments came with ecstasy on their wings; / Beauty unimaginable moved heaven-bare / Absolved from boundaries in the vasts of dream; / The cry of the Birds of Wonder called from the skies / To the deathless people of the shores of Light.

02.03_035:013 - Creation leaped straight from the hands of God; / Marvel and rapture wandered in the ways.

02.03_035:014 - Only to be was a supreme delight, / Life was a happy laughter of the soul / And Joy was king with Love for minister.

02.03_035:015 - The spirit’s luminousness was bodied there.

02.03_035:016t - Life’s contraries were lovers or natural friends / And her extremes keen edges of harmony: / Indulgence with a tender purity came / And nursed the god on her maternal breast: / There none was weak, so falsehood could not live; / Ignorance was a thin shade protecting light, / Imagination the free-will of Truth, / Pleasure a candidate for heaven’s fire; / The intellect was Beauty’s worshipper, / Strength was the slave of calm spiritual law, / Power laid its head upon the breasts of Bliss. #glory-of-life #gods-of-life #life-heavens #paradise-of-life-gods

02.03_035:017 - There were summit glories inconceivable, / Autonomies of wisdom’s still self-rule / And high dependencies of her virgin sun, / Illumined theocracies of the seeing soul / Throned in the power of the Transcendent’s ray.

02.03_035:018 - A vision of grandeurs, a dream of magnitudes / In sun-bright kingdoms moved with regal gait: / Assemblies, crowded senates of the gods, / Life’s puissances reigned on seats of marble will, / High dominations and autocracies / And laurelled strengths and armed imperative mights.

02.03_035:019 - All objects there were great and beautiful, / All beings wore a royal stamp of power.

02.03_035:020 - There sat the oligarchies of natural Law, / Proud violent heads served one calm monarch brow: / All the soul’s postures donned divinity.

02.03_035:021 - There met the ardent mutual intimacies / Of mastery’s joy and the joy of servitude / Imposed by Love on Love’s heart that obeys / And Love’s body held beneath a rapturous yoke.

02.03_035:022 - All was a game of meeting kinglinesses.

02.03_035:023 - For worship lifts the worshipper’s bowed strength / Close to the god’s pride and bliss his soul adores: / The ruler there is one with all he rules; / To him who serves with a free equal heart / Obedience is his princely training’s school, / His nobility’s coronet and privilege, / His faith is a high nature’s idiom, / His service a spiritual sovereignty.

02.03_035:024 - There were realms where Knowledge joined creative Power / In her high home and made her all his own: / The grand Illuminate seized her gleaming limbs / And filled them with the passion of his ray / Till all her body was its transparent house / And all her soul a counterpart of his soul.

02.03_035:025 - Apotheosised, transfigured by wisdom’s touch, / Her days became a luminous sacrifice; / An immortal moth in happy and endless fire, / She burned in his sweet intolerable blaze.

02.03_035:026 - A captive Life wedded her conqueror.

02.03_035:027 - In his wide sky she built her world anew; / She gave to mind’s calm pace the motor’s speed, / To thinking a need to live what the soul saw, / To living an impetus to know and see.

02.03_035:028 - His splendour grasped her, her puissance to him clung; / She crowned the Idea a king in purple robes, / Put her magic serpent sceptre in Thought’s grip, / Made forms his inward vision’s rhythmic shapes / And her acts the living body of his will.

02.03_035:029 - A flaming thunder, a creator flash, / His victor Light rode on her deathless Force; / A centaur’s mighty gallop bore the god.

02.03_035:030 - Life throned with mind, a double majesty.

02.03_035:031 - Worlds were there of a happiness great and grave / And action tinged with dream, laughter with thought, / And passion there could wait for its desire / Until it heard the near approach of God.

02.03_035:032 - Worlds were there of a childlike mirth and joy; / A carefree youthfulness of mind and heart / Found in the body a heavenly instrument; / It lit an aureate halo round desire / And freed the deified animal in the limbs / To divine gambols of love and beauty and bliss.

02.03_035:033 - On a radiant soil that gazed at heaven’s smile / A swift life-impulse stinted not nor stopped: / It knew not how to tire; happy were its tears.

02.03_035:034 - There work was play and play the only work, / The tasks of heaven a game of godlike might: / A celestial bacchanal for ever pure, / Unstayed by faintness as in mortal frames / Life was an eternity of rapture’s moods: / Age never came, care never lined the face.

02.03_035:035 - Imposing on the safety of the stars / A race and laughter of immortal strengths, / The nude God-children in their play-fields ran / Smiting the winds with splendour and with speed; / Of storm and sun they made companions, / Sported with the white mane of tossing seas, / Slew distance trampled to death under their wheels / And wrestled in the arenas of their force.

02.03_035:036 - Imperious in their radiance like the suns / They kindled heaven with the glory of their limbs / Flung like a divine largesse to the world.

02.03_035:037 - A spell to force the heart to stark delight, / They carried the pride and mastery of their charm / As if Life’s banner on the roads of Space.

02.03_035:038 - Ideas were luminous comrades of the soul; / Mind played with speech, cast javelins of thought, / But needed not these instruments’ toil to know; / Knowledge was Nature’s pastime like the rest.

02.03_035:039 - Investitured with the fresh heart’s bright ray, / An early God-instinct’s child inheritors, / Tenants of the perpetuity of Time / Still thrilling with the first creation’s bliss, / They steeped existence in their youth of soul.

02.03_035:040 - An exquisite and vehement tyranny, / The strong compulsion of their will to joy / Poured smiling streams of happiness through the world.

02.03_035:041 - There reigned a breath of high immune content, / A fortunate gait of days in tranquil air, / A flood of universal love and peace.

02.03_035:042 - A sovereignty of tireless sweetness lived / Like a song of pleasure on the lips of Time.

02.03_035:043 - A large spontaneous order freed the will, / A sun-frank winging of the soul to bliss, / The breadth and greatness of the unfettered act / And the swift fire-heart’s golden liberty.

02.03_035:044 - There was no falsehood of soul-severance, / There came no crookedness of thought or word / To rob creation of its native truth; / All was sincerity and natural force.

02.03_035:045 - There freedom was sole rule and highest law.

02.03_035:046 - In a happy series climbed or plunged these worlds: / In realms of curious beauty and surprise, / In fields of grandeur and of titan power, / Life played at ease with her immense desires.

02.03_035:047 - A thousand Edens she could build nor pause; / No bound was set to her greatness and to her grace / And to her heavenly variety.

02.03_035:048 - Awake with a cry and stir of numberless souls, / Arisen from the breast of some deep Infinite, / Smiling like a new-born child at love and hope, / In her nature housing the Immortal’s power, / In her bosom bearing the eternal Will, / No guide she needed but her luminous heart: / No fall debased the godhead of her steps, / No alien Night had come to blind her eyes.

02.03_035:049 - There was no use for grudging ring or fence; / Each act was a perfection and a joy.

02.03_035:050 - Abandoned to her rapid fancy’s moods / And the rich coloured riot of her mind, / Initiate of divine and mighty dreams, / Magician builder of unnumbered forms / Exploring the measures of the rhythms of God, / At will she wove her wizard wonder-dance, / A Dionysian goddess of delight, / A Bacchant of creative ecstasy.


Section I - 36: bright desirable dream


02.03_036:001 - This world of bliss he saw and felt its call, / But found no way to enter into its joy; / Across the conscious gulf there was no bridge.

02.03_036:002 - A darker air encircled still his soul / Tied to an image of unquiet life.

02.03_036:003 - In spite of yearning mind and longing sense, / To a sad Thought by grey experience formed / And a vision dimmed by care and sorrow and sleep / All this seemed only a bright desirable dream / Conceived in a longing distance by the heart / Of one who walks in the shadow of earth-pain.

02.03_036:004 - Although he once had felt the Eternal’s clasp, / Too near to suffering worlds his nature lived, / And where he stood were entrances of Night.

02.03_036:005 - Hardly, too close beset by the world’s care, / Can the dense mould in which we have been made / Return sheer joy to joy, pure light to light.

02.03_036:006 - For its tormented will to think and live / First to a mingled pain and pleasure woke / And still it keeps the habit of its birth: / A dire duality is our way to be.

02.03_036:007 - In the crude beginnings of this mortal world / Life was not nor mind’s play nor heart’s desire.

02.03_036:008 - When earth was built in the unconscious Void / And nothing was save a material scene, / Identified with sea and sky and stone / Her young gods yearned for the release of souls / Asleep in objects, vague, inanimate.

02.03_036:009 - In that desolate grandeur, in that beauty bare, / In the deaf stillness, mid the unheeded sounds, / Heavy was the uncommunicated load / Of Godhead in a world that had no needs; / For none was there to feel or to receive.

02.03_036:010 - This solid mass which brooked no throb of sense / Could not contain their vast creative urge: / Immersed no more in Matter’s harmony, / The Spirit lost its statuesque repose.

02.03_036:011 - In the uncaring trance it groped for sight, / Passioned for the movements of a conscious heart, / Famishing for speech and thought and joy and love, / In the dumb insensitive wheeling day and night / Hungered for the beat of yearning and response.

02.03_036:012 - The poised inconscience shaken with a touch, / The intuitive silence trembling with a name, / They cried to Life to invade the senseless mould / And in brute forms awake divinity.

02.03_036:013 - A voice was heard on the mute rolling globe, / A murmur moaned in the unlistening Void.

02.03_036:014 - A being seemed to breathe where once was none: / Something pent up in dead insentient depths, / Denied conscious existence, lost to joy, / Turned as if one asleep since dateless time.

02.03_036:015 - Aware of its own buried reality, / Remembering its forgotten self and right, / It yearned to know, to aspire, to enjoy, to live.

02.03_036:016 - Life heard the call and left her native light.

02.03_036:017 - Overflowing from her bright magnificent plane / On the rigid coil and sprawl of mortal space, / Here too the gracious great-winged Angel poured / Her splendour and her sweetness and her bliss, / Hoping to fill a fair new world with joy.

02.03_036:018 - As comes a goddess to a mortal’s breast / And fills his days with her celestial clasp, / She stooped to make her home in transient shapes; / In Matter’s womb she cast the Immortal’s fire, / In the unfeeling Vast woke thought and hope, / Smote with her charm and beauty flesh and nerve / And forced delight on earth’s insensible frame.

02.03_036:019 - Alive and clad with trees and herbs and flowers / Earth’s great brown body smiled towards the skies, / Azure replied to azure in the sea’s laugh; / New sentient creatures filled the unseen depths, / Life’s glory and swiftness ran in the beauty of beasts, / Man dared and thought and met with his soul the world.

02.03_036:020 - But while the magic breath was on its way, / Before her gifts could reach our prisoned hearts, / A dark ambiguous Presence questioned all.

02.03_036:021 - The secret Will that robes itself with Night / And offers to spirit the ordeal of the flesh, / Imposed a mystic mask of death and pain.

02.03_036:022 - Interned now in the slow and suffering years / Sojourns the winged and wonderful wayfarer / And can no more recall her happier state, / But must obey the inert Inconscient’s law, / Insensible foundation of a world / In which blind limits are on beauty laid / And sorrow and joy as struggling comrades live.

02.03_036:023 - A dim and dreadful muteness fell on her: / Abolished was her subtle mighty spirit / And slain her boon of child-god happiness, / And all her glory into littleness turned / And all her sweetness into a maimed desire.

02.03_036:024 - To feed death with her works is here life’s doom.

02.03_036:025 - So veiled was her immortality that she seemed, / Inflicting consciousness on unconscious things, / An episode in an eternal death, / A myth of being that must for ever cease.

02.03_036:026 - Such was the evil mystery of her change.


Canto 4 - 2.4: The Kingdoms of the Little Life

Section I - 37: uncertain world


02.04_037:001 - A quivering trepidant uncertain world / Born from that dolorous meeting and eclipse / Appeared in the emptiness where her feet had trod, / A quick obscurity, a seeking stir.

02.04_037:002 - There was a writhing of half-conscious force / Hardly awakened from inconscient sleep / And tied to an instinct-driven Ignorance, / To find itself and find its hold on things.

02.04_037:003 - Inheritor of poverty and loss, / Assailed by memories that fled when seized, / Haunted by a forgotten uplifting hope, / It strove with a blindness as of groping hands / To fill the aching and disastrous gap / Between earth-pain and the bliss from which Life fell.

02.04_037:004 - A world that ever seeks for something missed, / Hunting for a joy that earth has failed to keep, / Too near to our gates its unappeased unrest / For peace to live on the inert solid globe.

02.04_037:005 - It has joined its hunger to the hunger of earth, / It has given the law of craving to our lives, / It has made our spirit’s need a fathomless gulf.

02.04_037:006 - An Influence entered mortal night and day, / A shadow overcast the time-born race; / In the troubled stream where leaps a blind heart-pulse / And the nerve-beat of feeling wakes in sense / Dividing Matter’s sleep from conscious Mind, / There strayed a call that knew not why it came.

02.04_037:007 - A Power beyond earth’s scope has touched the earth; / The repose that might have been can be no more; / A formless yearning passions in man’s heart, / A cry is in his blood for happier things: / Else could he roam on a free sunlit soil / With the childlike pain-forgetting mind of beasts / Or live happy, unmoved, like flowers and trees.

02.04_037:008 - The Might that came upon the earth to bless / Has stayed on earth to suffer and aspire.

02.04_037:009 - The infant laugh that rang through time is hushed: / Man’s natural joy of life is overcast / And sorrow is his nurse of destiny.

02.04_037:010 - The animal’s thoughtless joy is left behind, / Care and reflection burden his daily walk: / He has risen to greatness and to discontent, / He is awake to the Invisible.

02.04_037:011 - Insatiate seeker, he has all to learn: / He has exhausted now life’s surface acts, / His being’s hidden realms remain to explore.

02.04_037:012 - He becomes a mind, he becomes a spirit and self; / In his fragile tenement he grows Nature’s lord.

02.04_037:013 - In him Matter wakes from its long obscure trance, / In him earth feels the Godhead drawing near.

02.04_037:014 - An eyeless Power that sees no more its aim, / A restless hungry energy of Will, / Life cast her seed in the body’s indolent mould; / It woke from happy torpor a blind Force / Compelling it to sense and seek and feel.

02.04_037:015 - In the enormous labour of the Void / Perturbing with her dreams the vast routine / And dead roll of a slumbering universe / The mighty prisoner struggled for release.

02.04_037:016 - Alive with her yearning woke the inert cell, / In the heart she kindled a fire of passion and need, / Amid the deep calm of inanimate things / Arose her great voice of toil and prayer and strife.

02.04_037:017 - A groping consciousness in a voiceless world, / A guideless sense was given her for her road; / Thought was withheld and nothing now she knew / But all the unknown was hers to feel and clasp.

02.04_037:018 - Obeying the push of unborn things towards birth / Out of her seal of insentient life she broke: / In her substance of unthinking mute soul-strength / That cannot utter what its depths divine, / Awoke a blind necessity to know.

02.04_037:019 - The chain that bound her she made her instrument; / Instinct was hers, the chrysalis of Truth, / And effort and growth and striving nescience.

02.04_037:020 - Inflicting on the body desire and hope, / Imposing on inconscience consciousness / She brought into Matter’s dull tenacity / Her anguished claim to her lost sovereign right, / Her tireless search, her vexed uneasy heart, / Her wandering unsure steps, her cry for change.

02.04_037:021 - Adorer of a joy without a name, / In her obscure cathedral of delight / To dim dwarf gods she offers secret rites.

02.04_037:022 - But vain unending is the sacrifice, / The priest an ignorant mage who only makes / Futile mutations in the altar’s plan / And casts blind hopes into a powerless flame.

02.04_037:023t - A burden of transient gains weighs down her steps / And hardly under that load can she advance; / But the hours cry to her, she travels on / Passing from thought to thought, from want to want; / Her greatest progress is a deepened need. #difficulty #divine-necessity #divine-process #divine-progress #greatest-progress #truth-of-things

02.04_037:024 - Matter dissatisfies, she turns to Mind; / She conquers earth, her field, then claims the heavens.

02.04_037:025 - Insensible, breaking the work she has done / The stumbling ages over her labour pass, / And still no great transforming light came down / And no revealing rapture touched her fall.

02.04_037:026 - Only a glimmer sometimes splits mind’s sky / Justifying the ambiguous providence / That makes of night a path to unknown dawns / Or a dark clue to some diviner state.

02.04_037:027 - In Nescience began her mighty task, / In Ignorance she pursues the unfinished work; / For Knowledge gropes, but meets not Wisdom’s face.

02.04_037:028 - Ascending slowly with unconscious steps, / A foundling of the gods she wanders here / Like a child-soul left near the gates of Hell / Fumbling through fog in search of Paradise.



Section I - 38: a grey obscurity


02.04_038:001 - In this slow ascension he must follow her pace / Even from her faint and dim subconscious start: / So only can earth’s last salvation come.

02.04_038:002 - For so only could he know the obscure cause / Of all that holds us back and baffles God / In the jail-delivery of the imprisoned soul.

02.04_038:003 - Along swift paths of fall through dangerous gates / He chanced into a grey obscurity / Teeming with instincts from the mindless gulfs / That pushed to wear a form and win a place.

02.04_038:004 - Life here was intimate with Death and Night / And ate Death’s food that she might breathe awhile; / She was their inmate and adopted waif.

02.04_038:005 - Accepting subconscience, in dumb darkness’ reign / A sojourner, she hoped not any more.

02.04_038:006 - There far away from Truth and luminous thought / He saw the original seat, the separate birth / Of the dethroned, deformed and suffering Power.

02.04_038:007 - An unhappy face of falsity made true, / A contradiction of our divine birth, / Indifferent to beauty and to light, / Parading she flaunted her animal disgrace / Unhelped by camouflage, brutal and bare, / An authentic image recognised and signed / Of her outcast force exiled from heaven and hope, / Fallen, glorying in the vileness of her state, / The grovel of a strength once half divine, / The graceless squalor of her beast desires, / The staring visage of her ignorance, / The naked body of her poverty.

02.04_038:008 - Here first she crawled out from her cabin of mud / Where she had lain inconscient, rigid, mute: / Its narrowness and torpor held her still, / A darkness clung to her uneffaced by Light.

02.04_038:009 - There neared no touch redeeming from above: / The upward look was alien to her sight, / Forgotten the fearless godhead of her walk; / Renounced was the glory and felicity, / The adventure in the dangerous fields of Time: / Hardly she availed, wallowing, to bear and live.


Section I - 39: vain unnecessary world


02.04_039:001 - A wide unquiet mist of seeking space, / A rayless region swallowed in vague swathes, / That seemed, unnamed, unbodied and unhoused, / A swaddled visionless and formless mind, / Asked for a body to translate its soul.

02.04_039:002 - Its prayer denied, it fumbled after thought.

02.04_039:003 - As yet not powered to think, hardly to live, / It opened into a weird and pigmy world / Where this unhappy magic had its source.

02.04_039:004 - On dim confines where Life and Matter meet / He wandered among things half-seen, half-guessed, / Pursued by ungrasped beginnings and lost ends.

02.04_039:005 - There life was born but died before it could live.

02.04_039:006 - There was no solid ground, no constant drift; / Only some flame of mindless Will had power.

02.04_039:007 - Himself was dim to himself, half-felt, obscure, / As if in a struggle of the Void to be.

02.04_039:008 - In strange domains where all was living sense / But mastering thought was not nor cause nor rule, / Only a crude child-heart cried for toys of bliss, / Mind flickered, a disordered infant-glow, / And random shapeless energies drove towards form / And took each wisp-fire for a guiding sun.

02.04_039:009 - This blindfold force could place no thinking step; / Asking for light she followed darkness’ clue.

02.04_039:010 - An inconscient Power groped towards consciousness, / Matter smitten by Matter glimmered to sense, / Blind contacts, slow reactions beat out sparks / Of instinct from a cloaked subliminal bed, / Sensations crowded, dumb substitutes for thought, / Perception answered Nature’s waking blows / But still was a mechanical response, / A jerk, a leap, a start in Nature’s dream, / And rude unchastened impulses jostling ran / Heedless of every motion but their own / And, darkling, clashed with darker than themselves, / Free in a world of settled anarchy.

02.04_039:011 - The need to exist, the instinct to survive / Engrossed the tense precarious moment’s will / And an unseeing desire felt out for food.

02.04_039:012 - The gusts of Nature were the only law, / Force wrestled with force but no result remained: / Only were achieved a nescient grasp and drive / And feelings and instincts knowing not their source, / Sense-pleasures and sense-pangs soon caught, soon lost, / And the brute motion of unthinking lives.

02.04_039:013 - It was a vain unnecessary world / Whose will to be brought poor and sad results / And meaningless suffering and a grey unease.

02.04_039:014 - Nothing seemed worth the labour to become.



Section I - 40: a solitary witness star


02.04_040:001 - But judged not so his spirit’s wakened eye.

02.04_040:002 - As shines a solitary witness star / That burns apart, Light’s lonely sentinel, / In the drift and teeming of a mindless Night, / A single thinker in an aimless world / Awaiting some tremendous dawn of God, / He saw the purpose in the works of Time.

02.04_040:003 - Even in that aimlessness a work was done / Pregnant with magic will and change divine.

02.04_040:004 - The first writhings of the cosmic serpent Force / Uncoiled from the mystic ring of Matter’s trance; / It raised its head in the warm air of life.

02.04_040:005 - It could not cast off yet Night’s stiffening sleep / Or wear as yet mind’s wonder-flecks and streaks, / Put on its jewelled hood the crown of soul / Or stand erect in the blaze of spirit’s sun.

02.04_040:006 - As yet were only seen foulness and force, / The secret crawl of consciousness to light / Through a fertile slime of lust and battening sense, / Beneath the body’s crust of thickened self / A tardy fervent working in the dark, / The turbid yeast of Nature’s passionate change, / Ferment of the soul’s creation out of mire.

02.04_040:007 - A heavenly process donned this grey disguise, / A fallen ignorance in its covert night / Laboured to achieve its dumb unseemly work, / A camouflage of the Inconscient’s need / To release the glory of God in Nature’s mud.

02.04_040:008 - His sight, spiritual in embodying orbs, / Could pierce through the grey phosphorescent haze / And scan the secrets of the shifting flux / That animates these mute and solid cells / And leads the thought and longing of the flesh / And the keen lust and hunger of its will.

02.04_040:009 - This too he tracked along its hidden stream / And traced its acts to a miraculous fount.

02.04_040:010 - A mystic Presence none can probe nor rule, / Creator of this game of ray and shade / In this sweet and bitter paradoxical life, / Asks from the body the soul’s intimacies / And by the swift vibration of a nerve / Links its mechanic throbs to light and love.

02.04_040:011 - It summons the spirit’s sleeping memories / Up from subconscient depths beneath Time’s foam; / Oblivious of their flame of happy truth, / Arriving with heavy eyes that hardly see, / They come disguised as feelings and desires, / Like weeds upon the surface float awhile / And rise and sink on a somnambulist tide.

02.04_040:012 - Impure, degraded though her motions are, / Always a heaven-truth broods in life’s deeps; / In our obscurest members burns that fire.

02.04_040:013 - A touch of God’s rapture in creation’s acts, / A lost remembrance of felicity / Lurks still in the dumb roots of death and birth, / The world’s senseless beauty mirrors God’s delight.

02.04_040:014 - That rapture’s smile is secret everywhere; / It flows in the wind’s breath, in the tree’s sap, / Its hued magnificence blooms in leaves and flowers.

02.04_040:015 - When life broke through its half-drowse in the plant / That feels and suffers but cannot move or cry, / In beast and in winged bird and thinking man / It made of the heart’s rhythm its music’s beat; / It forced the unconscious tissues to awake / And ask for happiness and earn the pang / And thrill with pleasure and laughter of brief delight, / And quiver with pain and crave for ecstasy.

02.04_040:016 - Imperative, voiceless, ill-understood, / Too far from light, too close to being’s core, / Born strangely in Time from the eternal Bliss, / It presses on heart’s core and vibrant nerve; / Its sharp self-seeking tears our consciousness; / Our pain and pleasure have that sting for cause; / Instinct with it, but blind to its true joy / The soul’s desire leaps out towards passing things.

02.04_040:017 - All Nature’s longing drive none can resist, / Comes surging through the blood and quickened sense; / An ecstasy of the infinite is her cause.

02.04_040:018 - It turns in us to finite loves and lusts, / The will to conquer and have, to seize and keep, / To enlarge life’s room and scope and pleasure’s range, / To battle and overcome and make one’s own, / The hope to mix one’s joy with other’s joy, / A yearning to possess and be possessed, / To enjoy and be enjoyed, to feel, to live.

02.04_040:019 - Here was its early brief attempt to be, / Its rapid end of momentary delight / Whose stamp of failure haunts all ignorant life.

02.04_040:020 - Inflicting still its habit on the cells / The phantom of a dark and evil start / Ghostlike pursues all that we dream and do.

02.04_040:021 - Although on earth are firm established lives, / A working of habit or a sense of law, / A steady repetition in the flux, / Yet are its roots of will ever the same; / These passions are the stuff of which we are made.

02.04_040:022 - This was the first cry of the awaking world.

02.04_040:023 - It clings around us still and clamps the god.

02.04_040:024 - Even when reason is born and soul takes form, / In beast and reptile and in thinking man / It lasts and is the fount of all their life.

02.04_040:025 - This too was needed that breath and living might be.

02.04_040:026 - The spirit in a finite ignorant world / Must rescue so its prisoned consciousness / Forced out in little jets at quivering points / From the Inconscient’s sealed infinitude.

02.04_040:027 - Then slowly it gathers mass, looks up at Light.

02.04_040:028 - This Nature lives tied to her origin, / A clutch of nether force is on her still; / Out of unconscious depths her instincts leap; / A neighbour is her life to insentient Nought.

02.04_040:029 - Under this law an ignorant world was made.

02.04_040:030 - In the enigma of the darkened Vasts, / In the passion and self-loss of the Infinite / When all was plunged in the negating Void, / Non-Being’s night could never have been saved / If Being had not plunged into the dark / Carrying with it its triple mystic cross.

02.04_040:031 - Invoking in world-time the timeless truth, / Bliss changed to sorrow, knowledge made ignorant, / God’s force turned into a child’s helplessness / Can bring down heaven by their sacrifice.

02.04_040:032 - A contradiction founds the base of life: / The eternal, the divine Reality / Has faced itself with its own contraries; / Being became the Void and Conscious-Force / Nescience and walk of a blind Energy / And Ecstasy took the figure of world-pain.

02.04_040:033 - In a mysterious dispensation’s law / A Wisdom that prepares its far-off ends / Planned so to start her slow aeonic game.

02.04_040:034 - A blindfold search and wrestle and fumbling clasp / Of a half-seen Nature and a hidden Soul, / A game of hide and seek in twilit rooms, / A play of love and hate and fear and hope / Continues in the nursery of mind / Its hard and heavy romp of self-born twins.

02.04_040:035 - At last the struggling Energy can emerge / And meet the voiceless Being in wider fields; / Then can they see and speak and, breast to breast, / In a larger consciousness, a clearer light, / The Two embrace and strive and each know each / Regarding closer now the playmate’s face.

02.04_040:036 - Even in these formless coilings he could feel / Matter’s response to an infant stir of soul.

02.04_040:037 - In Nature he saw the mighty Spirit concealed, / Watched the weak birth of a tremendous Force, / Pursued the riddle of Godhead’s tentative pace, / Heard the faint rhythms of a great unborn Muse.


Section I - 41: kingdom of the animal self


02.04_041:001 - Then came a fierier breath of waking life, / And there arose from the dim gulf of things / The strange creations of a thinking sense, / Existences half-real and half-dream.

02.04_041:002 - A life was there that hoped not to survive: / Beings were born who perished without trace, / Events that were a formless drama’s limbs / And actions driven by a blind creature will.

02.04_041:003 - A seeking Power found out its road to form, / Patterns were built of love and joy and pain / And symbol figures for the moods of Life.

02.04_041:004 - An insect hedonism fluttered and crawled / And basked in a sunlit Nature’s surface thrills, / And dragon raptures, python agonies / Crawled in the marsh and mire and licked the sun.

02.04_041:005 - Huge armoured strengths shook the frail quaking ground, / Great puissant creatures with a dwarfish brain, / And pigmy tribes imposed their small life-drift.

02.04_041:006 - In a dwarf model of humanity / Nature now launched the extreme experience / And master-point of her design’s caprice, / Luminous result of her half-conscious climb / On rungs twixt her sublimities and grotesques / To massive from infinitesimal shapes, / To a subtle balancing of body and soul, / To an order of intelligent littleness.

02.04_041:007 - Around him in the moment-beats of Time / The kingdom of the animal self arose, / Where deed is all and mind is still half-born / And the heart obeys a dumb unseen control.

02.04_041:008 - The Force that works by the light of Ignorance, / Her animal experiment began, / Crowding with conscious creatures her world-scheme; / But to the outward only were they alive, / Only they replied to touches and surfaces / And to the prick of need that drove their lives.

02.04_041:009 - A body that knew not its own soul within, / There lived and longed, had wrath and joy and grief; / A mind was there that met the objective world / As if a stranger or enemy at its door: / Its thoughts were kneaded by the shocks of sense; / It captured not the spirit in the form, / It entered not the heart of what it saw; / It looked not for the power behind the act, / It studied not the hidden motive in things / Nor strove to find the meaning of it all.

02.04_041:010 - Beings were there who wore a human form; / Absorbed they lived in the passion of the scene, / But knew not who they were or why they lived: / Life had for them no aim save Nature’s joy / And the stimulus and delight of outer things; / They worked for the body’s wants, they craved no more, / Content to breathe, to feel, to sense, to act, / Identified with the spirit’s outward shell.

02.04_041:011 - The veiled spectator watching from their depths / Fixed not his inward eye upon himself / Nor turned to find the author of the plot, / He saw the drama only and the stage.

02.04_041:012 - There was no brooding stress of deeper sense, / The burden of reflection was not borne: / Mind looked on Nature with unknowing eyes, / Adored her boons and feared her monstrous strokes.

02.04_041:013 - It pondered not on the magic of her laws, / It thirsted not for the secret wells of Truth, / But made a register of crowding facts / And strung sensations on a vivid thread: / It hunted and it fled and sniffed the winds, / Or slothed inert in sunshine and soft air: / It sought the engrossing contacts of the world, / But only to feed the surface sense with bliss.

02.04_041:014 - These felt life’s quiver in the outward touch, / They could not feel behind the touch the soul.

02.04_041:015 - To guard their form of self from Nature’s harm / To enjoy and to survive was all their care.

02.04_041:016 - The narrow horizon of their days was filled / With things and creatures that could help and hurt: / The world’s values hung upon their little self.

02.04_041:017 - Isolated, cramped in the vast unknown, / To save their small lives from surrounding Death / They made a tiny circle of defence / Against the siege of the huge universe: / They preyed upon the world and were its prey, / But never dreamed to conquer and be free.

02.04_041:018 - Obeying the World-Power’s hints and firm taboos / A scanty part they drew from her rich store; / There was no conscious code and no life-plan: / The patterns of thinking of a little group / Fixed a traditional behaviour’s law.

02.04_041:019 - Ignorant of soul save as a wraith within, / Tied to a mechanism of unchanging lives / And to a dull usual sense and feeling’s beat, / They turned in grooves of animal desire.

02.04_041:020 - In walls of stone fenced round they worked and warred, / Did by a banded selfishness a small good / Or wrought a dreadful wrong and cruel pain / On sentient lives and thought they did no ill.

02.04_041:021 - Ardent from the sack of happy peaceful homes / And gorged with slaughter, plunder, rape and fire, / They made of human selves their helpless prey, / A drove of captives led to lifelong woe / Or torture a spectacle made and holiday, / Mocking or thrilled by their torn victim’s pangs; / Admiring themselves as titans and as gods / Proudly they sang their high and glorious deeds / And praised their victory and their splendid force.

02.04_041:022 - An animal in the instinctive herd / Pushed by life impulses, forced by common needs, / Each in his own kind saw his ego’s glass; / All served the aim and action of the pack.

02.04_041:023 - Those like himself, by blood or custom kin, / To him were parts of his life, his adjunct selves, / His personal nebula’s constituent stars, / Satellite companions of his solar I.

02.04_041:024 - A master of his life’s environment, / A leader of a huddled human mass / Herding for safety on a dangerous earth / He gathered them round him as if minor Powers / To make a common front against the world, / Or, weak and sole on an indifferent earth, / As a fortress for his undefended heart, / Or else to heal his body’s loneliness.

02.04_041:025 - In others than his kind he sensed a foe, / An alien unlike force to shun and fear, / A stranger and adversary to hate and slay.

02.04_041:026 - Or he lived as lives the solitary brute; / At war with all he bore his single fate.

02.04_041:027 - Absorbed in the present act, the fleeting days, / None thought to look beyond the hour’s gains, / Or dreamed to make this earth a fairer world, / Or felt some touch divine surprise his heart.

02.04_041:028 - The gladness that the fugitive moment gave, / The desire grasped, the bliss, the experience won, / Movement and speed and strength were joy enough / And bodily longings shared and quarrel and play, / And tears and laughter and the need called love.

02.04_041:029 - In war and clasp these life-wants joined the All-Life, / Wrestlings of a divided unity / Inflicting mutual grief and happiness / In ignorance of the Self for ever one.

02.04_041:030 - Arming its creatures with delight and hope / A half-awakened Nescience struggled there / To know by sight and touch the outside of things.

02.04_041:031 - Instinct was formed; in memory’s crowded sleep / The past lived on as in a bottomless sea: / Inverting into half-thought the quickened sense / She felt around for truth with fumbling hands, / Clutched to her the little she could reach and seize / And put aside in her subconscient cave.

02.04_041:032 - So must the dim being grow in light and force / And rise to his higher destiny at last, / Look up to God and round at the universe, / And learn by failure and progress by fall / And battle with environment and doom, / By suffering discover his deep soul / And by possession grow to his own vasts.

02.04_041:033 - Half-way she stopped and found her faith no more.

02.04_041:034 - Still nothing was achieved but to begin, / Yet finished seemed the circle of her force, / Only she had beaten out sparks of ignorance, / Only the life could think and not the mind, / Only the sense could feel and not the soul, / Only was lit some heat of the flame of Life, / Some joy to be, some rapturous leaps of sense.

02.04_041:035 - All was an impetus of half-conscious Force, / A spirit sprawling drowned in dense life-foam, / A vague self grasping at the shape of things.

02.04_041:036 - Behind all moved seeking for vessels to hold / A first raw vintage of the grapes of God, / On earth’s mud a spilth of the supernal Bliss, / Intoxicating the stupefied soul and mind / A heady wine of rapture dark and crude, / Dim, uncast yet into spiritual form, / Obscure inhabitant of the world’s blind core, / An unborn godhead’s will, a mute desire.


Section I - 42: a narrow scope


02.04_042:001 - A third creation now revealed its face.

02.04_042:002 - A mould of body’s early mind was made.

02.04_042:003 - A glint of light kindled the obscure World-Force; / It dowered a driven world with the seeing Idea / And armed the act with Thought’s dynamic point: / A small thinking being watched the works of Time.

02.04_042:004 - A difficult evolution from below / Called a masked intervention from above; / Else this great, blind inconscient universe / Could never have disclosed its hidden mind, / Or even in blinkers worked in beast and man / The Intelligence that devised the cosmic scheme.

02.04_042:005 - At first he saw a dim obscure mind-power / Moving concealed by Matter and dumb life.

02.04_042:006 - A current thin, it streamed in life’s vast flow / Tossing and drifting under a drifting sky / Amid the surge and glimmering tremulous wash, / Released in splash of sense and feeling’s waves.

02.04_042:007 - In the deep midst of an unconscious world / Its huddled waves and foam of consciousness ran / Pressing and eddying through a narrow strait, / Carrying experience in its crowded pace.

02.04_042:008 - It flowed emerging into upper light / From the deep pool of its subliminal birth / To reach some high existence still unknown.

02.04_042:009 - There was no thinking self, aim there was none: / All was unrecognised stress and seekings vague.

02.04_042:010 - Only to the unstable surface rose / Sensations, stabs and edges of desire / And passion’s leaps and brief emotion’s cries, / A casual colloquy of flesh with flesh, / A murmur of heart to longing wordless heart, / Glimmerings of knowledge with no shape of thought / And jets of subconscious will or hunger’s pulls.

02.04_042:011 - All was dim sparkle on a foaming top: / It whirled around a drifting shadow-self / In an inconscient flood of Force in Time.

02.04_042:012 - Then came the pressure of a seeing Power / That drew all into a dancing turbid mass / Circling around a single luminous point, / Centre of reference in a conscious field, / Figure of a unitary Light within.

02.04_042:013 - It lit the impulse of the half-sentient flood, / Even an illusion gave of fixity / As if a sea could serve as a firm soil.

02.04_042:014 - That strange observing Power imposed its sight.

02.04_042:015 - It forced on flux a limit and a shape, / It gave its stream a lower narrow bank, / Drew lines to snare the spirit’s formlessness.

02.04_042:016 - It fashioned the life-mind of bird and beast, / The answer of the reptile and the fish, / The primitive pattern of the thoughts of man.

02.04_042:017 - A finite movement of the Infinite / Came winging its way through a wide air of Time; / A march of Knowledge moved in Nescience / And guarded in the form a separate soul.

02.04_042:018 - Its right to be immortal it reserved, / But built a wall against the siege of death / And threw a hook to clutch eternity.

02.04_042:019 - A thinking entity appeared in Space.

02.04_042:020 - A little ordered world broke into view / Where being had prison-room for act and sight, / A floor to walk, a clear but scanty range.

02.04_042:021 - An instrument-personality was born, / And a restricted clamped intelligence / Consented to restrain in narrow bounds / Its seeking; it tied the thought to visible things, / Prohibiting the adventure of the Unseen / And the soul’s tread through unknown infinities.

02.04_042:022 - A reflex reason, Nature-habit’s glass / Illumined life to know and fix its field, / Accepting a dangerous ignorant brevity / And the inconclusive purpose of its walk, / And profit by the hour’s precarious chance / In the allotted boundaries of its fate.

02.04_042:023 - A little joy and knowledge satisfied / This little being tied into a knot / And hung on a bulge of its environment, / A little curve cut off in measureless Space, / A little span of life in all vast Time.

02.04_042:024 - A thought was there that planned, a will that strove, / But for small aims within a narrow scope, / Wasting unmeasured toil on transient things.

02.04_042:025 - It knew itself a creature of the mud; / It asked no larger law, no loftier air; / It had no inward look, no upward gaze.

02.04_042:026 - A backward scholar on logic’s rickety bench / Indoctrinated by the erring sense, / It took appearance for the face of God, / For casual lights the marching of the suns, / For heaven a starry strip of doubtful blue; / Aspects of being feigned to be the whole.

02.04_042:027 - There was a voice of busy interchange, / A market-place of trivial thoughts and acts: / A life soon spent, a mind the body’s slave / Here seemed the brilliant crown of Nature’s works, / And tiny egos took the world as means / To sate awhile dwarf lusts and brief desires, / In a death-closed passage saw life’s start and end / As though a blind alley were creation’s sign, / As if for this the soul had coveted birth / In the wonderland of a self-creating world / And the opportunities of cosmic Space.

02.04_042:028 - This creature passionate only to survive, / Fettered to puny thoughts with no wide range / And to the body’s needs and pangs and joys, / This fire growing by its fuel’s death, / Increased by what it seized and made its own: / It gathered and grew and gave itself to none.

02.04_042:029 - Only it hoped for greatness in its den / And pleasure and victory in small fields of power / And conquest of life-room for self and kin, / An animal limited by its feeding-space.

02.04_042:030 - It knew not the Immortal in its house, / It had no greater deeper cause to live.

02.04_042:031 - In limits only it was powerful; / Acute to capture truth for outward use, / Its knowledge was the body’s instrument; / Absorbed in the little works of its prison-house / It turned around the same unchanging points / In the same circle of interest and desire, / But thought itself the master of its jail.

02.04_042:032 - Although for action, not for wisdom made, / Thought was its apex or its gutter’s rim: / It saw an image of the external world / And saw its surface self, but knew no more.

02.04_042:033 - Out of a slow confused embroiled self-search / Mind grew to a clarity cut out, precise, / A gleam enclosed in a stone ignorance.

02.04_042:034 - In this bound thinking’s narrow leadership / Tied to the soil, inspired by common things, / Attached to a confined familiar world, / Amid the multitude of her motived plots, / Her changing actors and her million masks, / Life was a play monotonously the same.

02.04_042:035 - There were no vast perspectives of the spirit, / No swift invasions of unknown delight, / No golden distances of wide release.

02.04_042:036 - This petty state resembled our human days / But fixed to eternity of changeless type, / A moment’s movement doomed to last through Time.

02.04_042:037 - Existence bridge-like spanned the inconscient gulfs, / A half-illumined building in a mist / Which from a void of Form arose to sight / And jutted out into a void of Soul.

02.04_042:038 - A little light in a great darkness born, / Life knew not where it went nor whence it came.

02.04_042:039 - Around all floated still the nescient haze.


Canto 5 - 2.5: The Godheads of the Little Life

Section I - 43: our doom (crooked fashioners)


02.05_043:001 - A fixed and narrow power with rigid forms, / He saw the empire of the little life, / An unhappy corner in eternity.

02.05_043:002 - It lived upon the margin of the Idea / Protected by Ignorance as in a shell.

02.05_043:003 - Then, hoping to learn the secret of this world / He peered across its scanty fringe of sight, / To disengage from its surface-clear obscurity / The Force that moved it and the Idea that made / Imposing smallness on the Infinite, / The ruling spirit of its littleness, / The divine law that gave it right to be, / Its claim on Nature and its need in Time.

02.05_043:004 - He plunged his gaze into the siege of mist / That held this ill-lit straitened continent / Ringed with the skies and seas of ignorance / And kept it safe from Truth and Self and Light.

02.05_043:005 - As when a search-light stabs the Night’s blind breast / And dwellings and trees and figures of men appear / As if revealed to an eye in Nothingness, / All lurking things were torn out of their veils / And held up in his vision’s sun-white blaze.

02.05_043:006 - A busy restless uncouth populace / Teemed in their dusky unnoted thousands there.

02.05_043:007 - In a mist of secrecy wrapping the world-scene / The little deities of Time’s nether act / Who work remote from Heaven’s controlling eye, / Plotted, unknown to the creatures whom they move, / The small conspiracies of this petty reign / Amused with the small contrivings, the brief hopes / And little eager steps and little ways / And reptile wallowings in the dark and dust, / And the crouch and ignominy of creeping life.

02.05_043:008 - A trepidant and motley multitude, / A strange pell-mell of magic artisans / Was seen moulding the plastic clay of life, / An elfin brood, an elemental kind.

02.05_043:009 - Astonished by the unaccustomed glow, / As if immanent in the shadows started up / Imps with wry limbs and carved beast visages, / Sprite prompters goblin-wizened or faery-small, / And genii fairer but unsouled and poor / And fallen beings, their heavenly portion lost, / And errant divinities trapped in Time’s dust.

02.05_043:010 - Ignorant and dangerous wills but armed with power, / Half-animal, half-god their mood, their shape.

02.05_043:011 - Out of the greyness of a dim background / Their whispers come, an inarticulate force, / Awake in mind an echoing thought or word, / To their sting of impulse the heart’s sanction draw, / And in that little Nature do their work / And fill its powers and creatures with unease.

02.05_043:012 - Its seed of joy they curse with sorrow’s fruit, / Put out with error’s breath its scanty lights / And turn its surface truths to falsehood’s ends, / Its small emotions spur, its passions drive / To the abyss or through the bog and mire: / Or else with a goad of hard dry lusts they prick, / While jogs on devious ways that nowhere lead / Life’s cart finding no issue from ignorance.

02.05_043:013 - To sport with good and evil is their law; / Luring to failure and meaningless success, / All models they corrupt, all measures cheat, / Make knowledge a poison, virtue a pattern dull / And lead the endless cycles of desire / Through semblances of sad or happy chance / To an inescapable fatality.

02.05_043:014 - All by their influence is enacted there.

02.05_043:015 - Nor there alone is their empire or their role: / Wherever are soulless minds and guideless lives / And in a small body self is all that counts, / Wherever love and light and largeness lack, / These crooked fashioners take up their task.

02.05_043:016 - To all half-conscious worlds they extend their reign.

02.05_043:017 - Here too these godlings drive our human hearts, / Our nature’s twilight is their lurking place.

02.05_043:018 - Here too the darkened primitive heart obeys / The veiled suggestions of a hidden Mind / That dogs our knowledge with misleading light / And stands between us and the truth that saves.

02.05_043:019 - It speaks to us with the voices of the Night: / Our darkened lives to greater darkness move; / Our seekings listen to calamitous hopes.

02.05_043:020 - A structure of unseeing thoughts is built / And reason used by an irrational Force.

02.05_043:021 - This earth alone is not our teacher and nurse; / The powers of all the worlds have entrance here.

02.05_043:022 - In their own fields they follow the wheel of law / And cherish the safety of a settled type; / On earth out of their changeless orbit thrown / Their law is kept, lost their fixed form of things.

02.05_043:023 - Into a creative chaos they are cast / Where all asks order but is driven by Chance; / Strangers to earth-nature, they must learn earth’s ways, / Aliens or opposites, they must unite: / They work and battle and with pain agree: / These join, those part, all parts and joins anew, / Till all have found their divine harmony.

02.05_043:024 - Our life’s uncertain way winds circling on, / Our mind’s unquiet search asks always light, / Till they have learnt their secret in their source, / In the light of the Timeless and its spaceless home, / In the joy of the Eternal sole and one.

02.05_043:025t - But now the Light supreme is far away: / Our conscious life obeys the inconscience’ laws; / To ignorant purposes and blind desires / Our hearts are moved by an ambiguous force; / Even our mind’s conquests wear a battered crown. #current-state-of-affairs #doom #great-difficulty #limitation #present-difficulty #soul #souls-bondage #the-ignorance #the-little-life

02.05_043:026 - A slowly changing order binds our will.

02.05_043:027 - This is our doom until our souls are free.

02.05_043:028 - A mighty Hand then rolls mind’s firmaments back, / Infinity takes up the finite’s acts / And Nature steps into the eternal Light.

02.05_043:029 - Then only ends this dream of nether life.



Section I - 44: egos moth wings


02.05_044:001 - At the outset of this enigmatic world / Which seems at once an enormous brute machine / And a slow unmasking of the Spirit in things, / In this revolving chamber without walls / In which God sits impassive everywhere / As if unknown to himself and by us unseen / In a miracle of inconscient secrecy, / Yet is all here his action and his will.

02.05_044:002 - In this whirl and sprawl through infinite vacancy / The Spirit became Matter and lay in the whirl, / A body sleeping without sense or soul.

02.05_044:003 - A mass phenomenon of visible shapes / Supported by the silence of the Void / Appeared in the eternal Consciousness / And seemed an outward and insensible world.

02.05_044:004 - There was none there to see and none to feel; / Only the miraculous Inconscient, / A subtle wizard skilled, was at its task.

02.05_044:005 - Inventing ways for magical results, / Managing creation’s marvellous device, / Marking mechanically dumb wisdom’s points, / Using the unthought inevitable Idea, / It did the works of God’s intelligence / Or wrought the will of some supreme Unknown.

02.05_044:006 - Still consciousness was hidden in Nature’s womb, / Unfelt was the Bliss whose rapture dreamed the worlds.

02.05_044:007 - Being was an inert substance driven by Force.

02.05_044:008 - At first was only an etheric Space: / Its huge vibrations circled round and round / Housing some unconceived initiative: / Upheld by a supreme original Breath / Expansion and contraction’s mystic act / Created touch and friction in the void, / Into abstract emptiness brought clash and clasp: / Parent of an expanding universe / In a matrix of disintegrating force, / By spending it conserved an endless sum.

02.05_044:009 - On the hearth of Space it kindled a viewless Fire / That, scattering worlds as one might scatter seeds, / Whirled out the luminous order of the stars.

02.05_044:010 - An ocean of electric Energy / Formlessly formed its strange wave-particles / Constructing by their dance this solid scheme, / Its mightiness in the atom shut to rest; / Masses were forged or feigned and visible shapes; / Light flung the photon’s swift revealing spark / And showed, in the minuteness of its flash / Imaged, this cosmos of apparent things.

02.05_044:011 - Thus has been made this real impossible world, / An obvious miracle or convincing show.

02.05_044:012 - Or so it seems to man’s audacious mind / Who seats his thought as the arbiter of truth, / His personal vision as impersonal fact, / As witnesses of an objective world / His erring sense and his instruments’ artifice.

02.05_044:013 - Thus must he work life’s tangible riddle out / In a doubtful light, by error seize on Truth / And slowly part the visage and the veil.

02.05_044:014 - Or else, forlorn of faith in mind and sense, / His knowledge a bright body of ignorance, / He sees in all things strangely fashioned here / The unwelcome jest of a deceiving Force, / A parable of Maya and her might.

02.05_044:015 - This vast perpetual motion caught and held / In the mysterious and unchanging change / Of the persistent movement we call Time / And ever renewing its recurrent beat, / These mobile rounds that stereotype a flux, / These static objects in the cosmic dance / That are but Energy’s self-repeating whirls / Prolonged by the spirit of the brooding Void, / Awaited life and sense and waking Mind.

02.05_044:016 - A little the Dreamer changed his pose of stone.

02.05_044:017 - But when the Inconscient’s scrupulous work was done / And Chance coerced by fixed immutable laws, / A scene was set for Nature’s conscious play.

02.05_044:018 - Then stirred the Spirit’s mute immobile sleep; / The Force concealed broke dumbly, slowly out.

02.05_044:019 - A dream of living woke in Matter’s heart, / A will to live moved in the Inconscient’s dust, / A freak of living startled vacant Time, / Ephemeral in a blank eternity, / Infinitesimal in a dead Infinite.

02.05_044:020 - A subtler breath quickened dead Matter’s forms; / The world’s set rhythm changed to a conscious cry; / A serpent Power twinned the insensible Force.

02.05_044:021 - Islands of living dotted lifeless space / And germs of living formed in formless air.

02.05_044:022 - A life was born that followed Matter’s law, / Ignorant of the motives of its steps; / Ever inconstant, yet for ever the same, / It repeated the paradox that gave it birth: / Its restless and unstable stabilities / Recurred incessantly in the flow of Time / And purposeful movements in unthinking forms / Betrayed the heavings of an imprisoned Will.

02.05_044:023 - Waking and sleep lay locked in mutual arms; / Helpless and indistinct came pleasure and pain / Trembling with the first faint thrills of a World-Soul.

02.05_044:024 - A strength of life that could not cry or move, / Yet broke into beauty signing some deep delight: / An inarticulate sensibility, / Throbs of the heart of an unknowing world, / Ran through its somnolent torpor and there stirred / A vague uncertain thrill, a wandering beat, / A dim unclosing as of secret eyes.

02.05_044:025 - Infant self-feeling grew and birth was born.

02.05_044:026 - A godhead woke but lay with dreaming limbs; / Her house refused to open its sealed doors.

02.05_044:027 - Insentient to our eyes that only see / The form, the act and not the imprisoned God, / Life hid in her pulse occult of growth and power / A consciousness with mute stifled beats of sense, / A mind suppressed that knew not yet of thought, / An inert spirit that could only be.

02.05_044:028 - At first she raised no voice, no motion dared: / Charged with world-power, instinct with living force, / Only she clung with her roots to the safe earth, / Thrilled dumbly to the shocks of ray and breeze / And put out tendril fingers of desire; / The strength in her yearning for sun and light / Felt not the embrace that made her breathe and live; / Absorbed she dreamed content with beauty and hue.

02.05_044:029 - At last the charmed Immensity looked forth: / Astir, vibrant, hungering, she groped for mind; / Then slowly sense quivered and thought peered out; / She forced the reluctant mould to grow aware.

02.05_044:030 - The magic was chiselled of a conscious form; / Its tranced vibrations rhythmed a quick response, / And luminous stirrings prompted brain and nerve, / Awoke in Matter spirit’s identity / And in a body lit the miracle / Of the heart’s love and the soul’s witness-gaze.

02.05_044:031 - Impelled by an unseen Will there could break out / Fragments of some vast impulse to become / And vivid glimpses of a secret self, / And the doubtful seeds and force of shapes to be / Awoke from the inconscient swoon of things.

02.05_044:032 - An animal creation crept and ran / And flew and called between the earth and sky, / Hunted by death but hoping still to live / And glad to breathe if only for a while.

02.05_044:033 - Then man was moulded from the original brute.

02.05_044:034 - A thinking mind had come to lift life’s moods, / A keen-edged tool of a Nature mixed and vague, / An intelligence half-witness, half-machine.

02.05_044:035 - This seeming driver of her wheel of works / Missioned to motive and record her drift / And fix its law on her inconstant powers, / This master-spring of a delicate enginery, / Aspired to enlighten its user and refine / Lifting to a vision of the indwelling Power / The absorbed mechanic’s crude initiative: / He raised his eyes; Heaven-light mirrored a Face.

02.05_044:036 - Amazed at the works wrought in her mystic sleep, / She looked upon the world that she had made: / Wondering now seized the great automaton; / She paused to understand her self and aim, / Pondering she learned to act by conscious rule, / A visioned measure guided her rhythmic steps; / Thought bordered her instincts with a frame of will / And lit with the idea her blinded urge.

02.05_044:037 - On her mass of impulses, her reflex acts, / On the Inconscient’s pushed or guided drift / And mystery of unthinking accurate steps / She stuck the specious image of a Self, / A living idol of disfigured spirit; / On Matter’s acts she imposed a patterned law; / She made a thinking body from chemic cells / And moulded a being out of a driven force.

02.05_044:038 - To be what she was not inflamed her hope: / She turned her dream towards some high Unknown; / A breath was felt below of One supreme.

02.05_044:039 - An opening looked up to spheres above / And coloured shadows limned on mortal ground / The passing figures of immortal things; / A quick celestial flash could sometimes come: / The illumined soul-ray fell on heart and flesh / And touched with semblances of ideal light / The stuff of which our earthly dreams are made.

02.05_044:040 - A fragile human love that could not last, / Ego’s moth-wings to lift the seraph soul, / Appeared, a surface glamour of brief date / Extinguished by a scanty breath of Time; / Joy that forgot mortality for a while / Came, a rare visitor who left betimes, / And made all things seem beautiful for an hour, / Hopes that soon fade to drab realities / And passions that crumble to ashes while they blaze / Kindled the common earth with their brief flame.

02.05_044:041 - A creature insignificant and small / Visited, uplifted by an unknown Power, / Man laboured on his little patch of earth / For means to last, to enjoy, to suffer and die.

02.05_044:042 - A spirit that perished not with the body and breath / Was there like a shadow of the Unmanifest / And stood behind the little personal form / But claimed not yet this earthly embodiment.

02.05_044:043 - Assenting to Nature’s long slow-moving toil, / Watching the works of his own ignorance, / Unknown, unfelt the mighty Witness lives / And nothing shows the Glory that is here.

02.05_044:044 - A Wisdom governing the mystic world, / A Silence listening to the cry of Life, / It sees the hurrying crowd of moments stream / Towards the still greatness of a distant hour.



Section I - 45: imagined citadels


02.05_045:001 - This huge world unintelligibly turns / In the shadow of a mused Inconscience; / It hides a key to inner meanings missed, / It locks in our hearts a voice we cannot hear.

02.05_045:002 - An enigmatic labour of the Spirit, / An exact machine of which none knows the use, / An art and ingenuity without sense, / This minute elaborate orchestrated life / For ever plays its motiveless symphonies.

02.05_045:003 - The mind learns and knows not, turning its back to truth; / It studies surface laws by surface thought, / Life’s steps surveys and Nature’s process sees, / Not seeing for what she acts or why we live; / It marks her tireless care of just device, / Her patient intricacy of fine detail, / The ingenious spirit’s brave inventive plan / In her great futile mass of endless works, / Adds purposeful figures to her purposeless sum, / Its gabled storeys piles, its climbing roofs / On the close-carved foundations she has laid, / Imagined citadels reared in mythic air / Or mounts a stair of dream to a mystic moon: / Transient creations point and hit the sky: / A world-conjecture’s scheme is laboured out / On the dim floor of mind’s incertitude, / Or painfully built a fragmentary whole.

02.05_045:004 - Impenetrable, a mystery recondite / Is the vast plan of which we are a part; / Its harmonies are discords to our view, / Because we know not the great theme they serve.

02.05_045:005 - Inscrutable work the cosmic agencies.

02.05_045:006 - Only the fringe of a wide surge we see; / Our instruments have not that greater light, / Our will tunes not with the eternal Will, / Our heart’s sight is too blind and passionate.

02.05_045:007 - Impotent to share in Nature’s mystic tact, / Inapt to feel the pulse and core of things, / Our reason cannot sound life’s mighty sea / And only counts its waves and scans its foam; / It knows not whence these motions touch and pass, / It sees not whither sweeps the hurrying flood: / Only it strives to canalise its powers / And hopes to turn its course to human ends: / But all its means come from the Inconscient’s store.

02.05_045:008 - Unseen here act dim huge world-energies / And only trickles and currents are our share.

02.05_045:009 - Our mind lives far off from the authentic Light / Catching at little fragments of the Truth, / In a small corner of infinity, / Our lives are inlets of an ocean’s force.

02.05_045:010 - Our conscious movements have sealed origins / But with those shadowy seats no converse hold; / No understanding binds our comrade parts; / Our acts emerge from a crypt our minds ignore.

02.05_045:011 - Our deepest depths are ignorant of themselves; / Even our body is a mystery shop; / As our earth’s roots lurk screened below our earth, / So lie unseen our roots of mind and life.

02.05_045:012 - Our springs are kept close hid beneath, within; / Our souls are moved by powers behind the wall.

02.05_045:013 - In the subterranean reaches of the spirit / A puissance acts and recks not what it means; / Using unthinking monitors and scribes, / It is the cause of what we think and feel.

02.05_045:014 - The troglodytes of the subconscious Mind, / Ill-trained slow stammering interpreters, / Only of their small task’s routine aware / And busy with the record in our cells, / Concealed in the subliminal secrecies / Mid an obscure occult machinery, / Capture the mystic Morse whose measured lilt / Transmits the messages of the cosmic Force.

02.05_045:015 - A whisper falls into life’s inner ear / And echoes from the dun subconscient caves, / Speech leaps, thought quivers, the heart vibrates, the will / Answers and tissue and nerve obey the call.

02.05_045:016 - Our lives translate these subtle intimacies; / All is the commerce of a secret Power.

02.05_045:017 -     A thinking puppet is the mind of life: / Its choice is the work of elemental strengths / That know not their own birth and end and cause / And glimpse not the immense intent they serve.

02.05_045:018 - In this nether life of man drab-hued and dull, / Yet filled with poignant small ignoble things, / The conscious Doll is pushed a hundred ways / And feels the push but not the hands that drive.

02.05_045:019 - For none can see the masked ironic troupe / To whom our figure-selves are marionettes, / Our deeds unwitting movements in their grasp, / Our passionate strife an entertainment’s scene.

02.05_045:020 - Ignorant themselves of their own fount of strength / They play their part in the enormous Whole.

02.05_045:021 - Agents of darkness imitating light, / Spirits obscure and moving things obscure, / Unwillingly they serve a mightier Power.

02.05_045:022 - Ananke’s engines organising Chance, / Channels perverse of a stupendous Will, / Tools of the Unknown who use us as their tools, / Invested with Power in Nature’s nether state, / Into the actions mortals think their own / They bring the incoherences of Fate, / Or make a doom of Time’s slipshod caprice / And toss the lives of men from hand to hand / In an inconsequent and devious game.

02.05_045:023 - Against all higher Truth their stuff rebels; / Only to Titan force their will lies prone.

02.05_045:024 - Inordinate their hold on human hearts, / In all our nature’s turns they intervene.

02.05_045:025 - Insignificant architects of low-built lives / And engineers of interest and desire, / Out of crude earthiness and muddy thrills / And coarse reactions of material nerve / They build our huddled structures of self-will / And the ill-lighted mansions of our thought, / Or with the ego’s factories and marts / Surround the beautiful temple of the soul.

02.05_045:026 - Artists minute of the hues of littleness, / They set the mosaic of Life’s comedy / Or plan the trivial tragedy of our days, / Arrange the deed, combine the circumstance / And the fantasia of the moods costume.

02.05_045:027 - These unwise prompters of man’s ignorant heart / And tutors of his stumbling speech and will, / Movers of petty wraths and lusts and hates / And changeful thoughts and shallow emotion’s starts, / These slight illusion-makers with their masks, / Painters of the decor of a dull-hued stage / And nimble scene-shifters of the human play, / Ever are busy with this ill-lit scene.

02.05_045:028 - Ourselves incapable to build our fate / Only as actors speak and strut our parts / Until the piece is done and we pass off / Into a brighter Time and subtler Space.

02.05_045:029 - Thus they inflict their little pigmy law / And curb the mounting slow uprise of man, / Then his too scanty walk with death they close.



Section I - 46: half-light below


02.05_046:001 - This is the ephemeral creature’s daily life.

02.05_046:002 - As long as the human animal is lord / And a dense nether nature screens the soul, / As long as intellect’s outward-gazing sight / Serves earthy interest and creature joys, / An incurable littleness pursues his days, / Ever since consciousness was born on earth, / Life is the same in insect, ape and man, / Its stuff unchanged, its way the common route.

02.05_046:003 - If new designs, if richer details grow / And thought is added and more tangled cares, / If little by little it wears a brighter face, / Still even in man the plot is mean and poor.

02.05_046:004t - A gross content prolongs his fallen state; / His small successes are failures of the soul, / His little pleasures punctuate frequent griefs: / Hardship and toil are the heavy price he pays / For the right to live and his last wages death. #cost-of-life #fallen-state #little-joys #self-binding #self-emprisonment #self-restriction #smallness #the-little-life

02.05_046:005 - An inertia sunk towards inconscience, / A sleep that imitates death is his repose.

02.05_046:006 - A puny splendour of creative force / Is made his spur to fragile human works / Which yet outlast their brief creator’s breath.

02.05_046:007 - He dreams sometimes of the revels of the gods / And sees the Dionysian gesture pass,— / A leonine greatness that would tear his soul / If through his failing limbs and fainting heart / The sweet and joyful mighty madness swept: / Trivial amusements stimulate and waste / The energy given to him to grow and be.

02.05_046:008 - His little hour is spent in little things.

02.05_046:009 - A brief companionship with many jars, / A little love and jealousy and hate, / A touch of friendship mid indifferent crowds / Draw his heart-plan on life’s diminutive map.

02.05_046:010 - If something great awakes, too frail his pitch / To reveal its zenith tension of delight, / His thought to eternise its ephemeral soar, / Art’s brilliant gleam is a pastime for his eyes, / A thrill that smites the nerves is music’s spell.

02.05_046:011 - Amidst his harassed toil and welter of cares, / Pressed by the labour of his crowding thoughts, / He draws sometimes around his aching brow / Nature’s calm mighty hands to heal his life-pain.

02.05_046:012 - He is saved by her silence from his rack of self; / In her tranquil beauty is his purest bliss.

02.05_046:013 - A new life dawns, he looks out from vistas wide; / The Spirit’s breath moves him but soon retires: / His strength was not made to hold that puissant guest.

02.05_046:014 - All dulls down to convention and routine / Or a fierce excitement brings him vivid joys: / His days are tinged with the red hue of strife / And lust’s hot glare and passion’s crimson stain; / Battle and murder are his tribal game.

02.05_046:015 - Time has he none to turn his eyes within / And look for his lost self and his dead soul.

02.05_046:016 - His motion on too short an axis wheels; / He cannot soar but creeps on his long road / Or if, impatient of the trudge of Time, / He would make a splendid haste on Fate’s slow road, / His heart that runs soon pants and tires and sinks; / Or he walks ever on and finds no end.

02.05_046:017 - Hardly a few can climb to greater life.

02.05_046:018 - All tunes to a low scale and conscious pitch.

02.05_046:019 - His knowledge dwells in the house of Ignorance; / His force nears not even once the Omnipotent, / Rare are his visits of heavenly ecstasy.

02.05_046:020 - The bliss which sleeps in things and tries to wake, / Breaks out in him in a small joy of life: / This scanty grace is his persistent stay; / It lightens the burden of his many ills / And reconciles him to his little world.

02.05_046:021 - He is satisfied with his common average kind; / Tomorrow’s hopes and his old rounds of thought, / His old familiar interests and desires / He has made a thick and narrowing hedge / Defending his small life from the Invisible; / His being’s kinship to infinity / He has shut away from him into inmost self, / Fenced off the greatnesses of hidden God.

02.05_046:022 - His being was formed to play a trivial part / In a little drama on a petty stage; / In a narrow plot he has pitched his tent of life / Beneath the wide gaze of the starry Vast.

02.05_046:023 - He is the crown of all that has been done: / Thus is creation’s labour justified; / This is the world’s result, Nature’s last poise!

02.05_046:024 - And if this were all and nothing more were meant, / If what now seems were the whole of what must be, / If this were not a stade through which we pass / On our road from Matter to eternal Self, / To the Light that made the worlds, the Cause of things, / Well might interpret our mind’s limited view / Existence as an accident in Time, / Illusion or phenomenon or freak, / The paradox of a creative Thought / Which moves between unreal opposites, / Inanimate Force struggling to feel and know, / Matter that chanced to read itself by Mind, / Inconscience monstrously engendering soul.

02.05_046:025 - At times all looks unreal and remote: / We seem to live in a fiction of our thoughts / Pieced from sensation’s fanciful traveller’s tale, / Or caught on the film of the recording brain, / A figment or circumstance in cosmic sleep.

02.05_046:026 - A somnambulist walking under the moon, / An image of ego treads through an ignorant dream / Counting the moments of a spectral Time.

02.05_046:027 - In a false perspective of effect and cause, / Trusting to a specious prospect of world-space, / It drifts incessantly from scene to scene, / Whither it knows not, to what fabulous verge.

02.05_046:028 - All here is dreamed or doubtfully exists, / But who the dreamer is and whence he looks / Is still unknown or only a shadowy guess.

02.05_046:029 - Or the world is real but ourselves too small, / Insufficient for the mightiness of our stage.

02.05_046:030 - A thin life-curve crosses the titan whirl / Of the orbit of a soulless universe, / And in the belly of the sparse rolling mass / A mind looks out from a small casual globe / And wonders what itself and all things are.

02.05_046:031 - And yet to some interned subjective sight / That strangely has formed in Matter’s sightless stuff, / A pointillage minute of little self / Takes figure as world-being’s conscious base.

02.05_046:032 - Such is our scene in the half-light below.

02.05_046:033 - This is the sign of Matter’s infinite, / This the weird purport of the picture shown / To Science the giantess, measurer of her field, / As she pores on the record of her close survey / And mathematises her huge external world, / To Reason bound within the circle of sense, / Or in Thought’s broad impalpable Exchange / A speculator in tenuous vast ideas, / Abstractions in the void her currency / We know not with what firm values for its base.

02.05_046:034 - Only religion in this bankruptcy / Presents its dubious riches to our hearts / Or signs unprovisioned cheques on the Beyond: / Our poverty shall there have its revenge.

02.05_046:035 - Our spirits depart discarding a futile life / Into the black unknown or with them take / Death’s passport into immortality.


Section I - 47: hope and destiny of life


02.05_047:001 - Yet was this only a provisional scheme, / A false appearance sketched by limiting sense, / Mind’s insufficient self-discovery, / An early attempt, a first experiment.

02.05_047:002 - This was a toy to amuse the infant earth; / But knowledge ends not in these surface powers / That live upon a ledge in the Ignorance / And dare not look into the dangerous depths / Or to stare upward measuring the Unknown.

02.05_047:003 - There is a deeper seeing from within / And, when we have left these small purlieus of mind, / A greater vision meets us on the heights / In the luminous wideness of the Spirit’s gaze.

02.05_047:004 - At last there wakes in us a witness Soul / That looks at truths unseen and scans the Unknown; / Then all assumes a new and marvellous face.

02.05_047:005 - The world quivers with a God-light at its core, / In Time’s deep heart high purposes move and live, / Life’s borders crumble and join infinity.

02.05_047:006 - This broad, confused, yet rigid scheme becomes / A magnificent imbroglio of the Gods, / A game, a work ambiguously divine.

02.05_047:007 - Our seekings are short-lived experiments / Made by a wordless and inscrutable Power / Testing its issues from inconscient Night / To meet its luminous self of Truth and Bliss.

02.05_047:008 - It peers at the Real through the apparent form; / It labours in our mortal mind and sense; / Amid the figures of the Ignorance, / In the symbol pictures drawn by word and thought, / It seeks the truth to which all figures point; / It looks for the source of Light with vision’s lamp; / It works to find the doer of all works, / The unfelt Self within who is the guide, / The unknown Self above who is the goal.

02.05_047:009 - All is not here a blinded Nature’s task: / A Word, a Wisdom watches us from on high, / A Witness sanctioning her will and works, / An Eye unseen in the unseeing vast; / There is an Influence from a Light above, / There are thoughts remote and sealed eternities; / A mystic motive drives the stars and suns.

02.05_047:010 - In this passage from a deaf unknowing Force / To struggling consciousness and transient breath / A mighty supernature waits on Time.

02.05_047:011 - The world is other than we now think and see, / Our lives a deeper mystery than we have dreamed; / Our minds are starters in the race to God, / Our souls deputed selves of the Supreme.

02.05_047:012 - Across the cosmic field through narrow lanes / Asking a scanty dole from Fortune’s hands / And garbed in beggar’s robes there walks the One.

02.05_047:013 - Even in the theatre of these small lives / Behind the act a secret sweetness breathes, / An urge of miniature divinity.

02.05_047:014 - A mystic passion from the wells of God / Flows through the guarded spaces of the soul; / A force that helps, supports the suffering earth, / An unseen nearness and a hidden joy. #divine-assurance #truth-of-things #hidden-truth

02.05_047:015 - There are muffled throbs of laughter’s undertones, / The murmur of an occult happiness, / An exultation in the depths of sleep, / A heart of bliss within a world of pain. #reassurance

02.05_047:016 - An Infant nursed on Nature’s covert breast, / An Infant playing in the magic woods, / Fluting to rapture by the Spirit’s streams, / Awaits the hour when we shall turn to his call.

02.05_047:017 - In this investiture of fleshly life / A soul that is a spark of God survives / And sometimes it breaks through the sordid screen / And kindles a fire that makes us half-divine.

02.05_047:018 - In our body’s cells there sits a hidden Power / That sees the unseen and plans eternity, / Our smallest parts have room for deepest needs; / There too the golden Messengers can come: / A door is cut in the mud wall of self; / Across the lowly threshold with bowed heads / Angels of ecstasy and self-giving pass, / And lodged in an inner sanctuary of dream / The makers of the image of deity live.

02.05_047:019 - Pity is there and fire-winged sacrifice, / And flashes of sympathy and tenderness / Cast heaven-lights from the heart’s secluded shrine.

02.05_047:020 - A work is done in the deep silences; / A glory and wonder of spiritual sense, / A laughter in beauty’s everlasting space / Transforming world-experience into joy, / Inhabit the mystery of the untouched gulfs; / Lulled by Time’s beats eternity sleeps in us.

02.05_047:021 - In the sealed hermetic heart, the happy core, / Unmoved behind this outer shape of death / The eternal Entity prepares within / Its matter of divine felicity, / Its reign of heavenly phenomenon.

02.05_047:022 - Even in our sceptic mind of ignorance / A foresight comes of some immense release, / Our will lifts towards it slow and shaping hands.

02.05_047:023t - Each part in us desires its absolute: / Our thoughts covet the everlasting Light, / Our strength derives from an omnipotent Force, / And since from a veiled God-joy the worlds were made / And since eternal beauty asks for form / Even here where all is made of being’s dust, / Our hearts are captured by ensnaring shapes, / Our very senses blindly seek for bliss. #divine-aim #divine-potentials #divine-request #high-revelation #parts-of-the-self #self-knowledge #self-needs #truth-of-things

02.05_047:024 - Our error crucifies Reality / To force its birth and divine body here, / Compelling, incarnate in a human form / And breathing in limbs that one can touch and clasp, / Its knowledge to rescue ancient Ignorance, / Its saviour light the inconscient universe.

02.05_047:025 - And when that greater Self comes sea-like down / To fill this image of our transience, / All shall be captured by delight, transformed: / In waves of undreamed ecstasy shall roll / Our mind and life and sense and laugh in a light / Other than this hard limited human day, / The body’s tissues thrill apotheosised, / Its cells sustain bright metamorphosis.

02.05_047:026 - This little being of Time, this shadow-soul, / This living dwarf figure-head of darkened spirit / Out of its traffic of petty dreams shall rise.

02.05_047:027 - Its shape of person and its ego face / Divested of this mortal travesty, / Like a clay troll kneaded into a god, / New-made in the image of the eternal Guest, / It shall be caught to the breast of a white Force / And, flaming with the paradisal touch / In a rose-fire of sweet spiritual grace, / In the red passion of its infinite change, / Quiver, awake, and shudder with ecstasy.

02.05_047:028 - As if reversing a deformation’s spell, / Released from the black magic of the Night, / Renouncing servitude to the dark Abyss, / It shall learn at last who lived within unseen / And seized with marvel in the adoring heart / To the enthroned Child-Godhead kneel aware, / Trembling with beauty and delight and love.

02.05_047:029 - But first the spirit’s ascent we must achieve / Out of the chasm from which our nature rose.

02.05_047:030 - The soul must soar sovereign above the form / And climb to summits beyond mind’s half-sleep; / Our hearts we must inform with heavenly strength, / Surprise the animal with the occult god.

02.05_047:031 - Then kindling the gold tongue of sacrifice, / Calling the powers of a bright hemisphere, / We shall shed the discredit of our mortal state, / Make the abysm a road for Heaven’s descent, / Acquaint our depths with the supernal Ray / And cleave the darkness with the mystic Fire.


Section I - 48: dark and measureless cave


02.05_048:001 - Adventuring once more in the natal mist / Across the dangerous haze, the pregnant stir, / He through the astral chaos shore a way / Mid the grey faces of its demon gods, / Questioned by whispers of its flickering ghosts, / Besieged by sorceries of its fluent force.

02.05_048:002 - As one who walks unguided through strange fields / Tending he knows not where nor with what hope, / He trod a soil that failed beneath his feet / And journeyed in stone strength to a fugitive end.

02.05_048:003 - His trail behind him was a vanishing line / Of glimmering points in a vague immensity; / A bodiless murmur travelled at his side / In the wounded gloom complaining against light.

02.05_048:004 - A huge obstruction its immobile heart, / The watching opacity multiplied as he moved / Its hostile mass of dead and staring eyes; / The darkness glimmered like a dying torch.

02.05_048:005 - Around him an extinguished phantom glare / Peopled with shadowy and misleading shapes / The vague Inconscient’s dark and measureless cave.

02.05_048:006 - His only sunlight was his spirit’s flame.


Canto 6 - 2.6: The Kingdoms and Godheads of the Greater Life

Section I - 49: region of promise

The Kingdoms and Godheads of the Greater Life

02.06_049:001 - As one who between dim receding walls / Towards the far gleam of a tunnel’s mouth, / Hoping for light, walks now with freer pace / And feels approach a breath of wider air, / So he escaped from that grey anarchy.

02.06_049:002 - Into an ineffectual world he came, / A purposeless region of arrested birth / Where being from non-being fled and dared / To live but had no strength long to abide.

02.06_049:003 - Above there gleamed a pondering brow of sky / Tormented, crossed by wings of doubtful haze / Adventuring with a voice of roaming winds / And crying for a direction in the void / Like blind souls looking for the selves they lost / And wandering through unfamiliar worlds; / Wings of vague questioning met the query of Space.

02.06_049:004 - After denial dawned a dubious hope, / A hope of self and form and leave to live / And the birth of that which never yet could be, / And joy of the mind’s hazard, the heart’s choice, / Grace of the unknown and hands of sudden surprise / And a touch of sure delight in unsure things: / To a strange uncertain tract his journey came / Where consciousness played with unconscious self / And birth was an attempt or episode.

02.06_049:005 - A charm drew near that could not keep its spell, / An eager Power that could not find its way, / A Chance that chose a strange arithmetic / But could not bind with it the forms it made, / A multitude that could not guard its sum / Which less than zero grew and more than one.

02.06_049:006 - Arriving at a large and shadowy sense / That cared not to define its fleeting drift / Life laboured in a strange and mythic air / Denuded of her sweet magnificent suns.

02.06_049:007 - In worlds imagined, never yet made true, / A lingering glimmer on creation’s verge, / One strayed and dreamed and never stopped to achieve: / To achieve would have destroyed that magic Space.

02.06_049:008 - The marvels of a twilight wonderland, / Full of a beauty strangely, vainly made, / A surge of fanciful realities, / Dim tokens of a Splendour sealed above, / Awoke the passion of the eyes’ desire, / Compelled belief on the enamoured thought / And drew the heart but led it to no goal.

02.06_049:009 - A magic flowed as if of moving scenes / That kept awhile their fugitive delicacy / Of sparing lines limned by an abstract art / In a rare scanted light with faint dream-brush / On a silver background of incertitude.

02.06_049:010 - An infant glow of heavens near to morn, / A fire intense conceived but never lit, / Caressed the air with ardent hints of day.

02.06_049:011 - The perfect longing for imperfection’s charm, / The illumined caught by the snare of Ignorance, / Ethereal creatures drawn by body’s lure / To that region of promise, beating invisible wings, / Came hungry for the joy of finite life / But too divine to tread created soil / And share the fate of perishable things.

02.06_049:012 - The Children of the unembodied Gleam / Arisen from a formless thought in the soul / And chased by an imperishable desire, / Traversed the field of the pursuing gaze.

02.06_049:013 - A will that unpersisting failed, worked there: / Life was a search but finding never came.

02.06_049:014 - There nothing satisfied, but all allured, / Things seemed to be that never wholly are, / Images were seen that looked like living acts / And symbols hid the sense they claimed to show, / Pale dreams grew real to the dreamer’s eyes.

02.06_049:015 - The souls came there that vainly strive for birth, / And spirits entrapped might wander through all time, / Yet never find the truth by which they live.

02.06_049:016 - All ran like hopes that hunt a lurking chance; / Nothing was solid, nothing felt complete: / All was unsafe, miraculous and half-true.

02.06_049:017 - It seemed a realm of lives that had no base.


Section I - 50: kingdom of the morning star


02.06_050:001 - Then dawned a greater seeking, broadened sky, / A journey under wings of brooding Force.

02.06_050:002 - First came the kingdom of the morning star: / A twilight beauty trembled under its spear / And the throb of promise of a wider Life.

02.06_050:003 - Then slowly rose a great and doubting sun / And in its light she made of self a world.

02.06_050:004 - A spirit was there that sought for its own deep self, / Yet was content with fragments pushed in front / And parts of living that belied the Whole / But, pieced together, might one day be true.

02.06_050:005 - Yet something seemed to be achieved at last.

02.06_050:006 - A growing volume of the will to be, / A text of living and a graph of force, / A script of acts, a song of conscious forms / Burdened with meanings fugitive from thought’s grasp / And crowded with undertones of life’s rhythmic cry, / Could write itself on the hearts of living things.

02.06_050:007 - In an outbreak of the might of secret Spirit, / In Life and Matter’s answer of delight, / Some face of deathless beauty could be caught / That gave immortality to a moment’s joy, / Some word that could incarnate highest Truth / Leaped out from a chance tension of the soul, / Some hue of the Absolute could fall on life, / Some glory of knowledge and intuitive sight, / Some passion of the rapturous heart of Love.

02.06_050:008 - A hierophant of the bodiless Secrecy / Interned in an unseen spiritual sheath, / The Will that pushes sense beyond its scope / To feel the light and joy intangible, / Half found its way into the Ineffable’s peace, / Half captured a sealed sweetness of desire / That yearned from a bosom of mysterious Bliss, / Half manifested veiled Reality.

02.06_050:009 - A soul not wrapped into its cloak of mind / Could glimpse the true sense of a world of forms; / Illumined by a vision in the thought, / Upbuoyed by the heart’s understanding flame, / It could hold in the conscious ether of the spirit / The divinity of a symbol universe.

02.06_050:010 -     This realm inspires us with our vaster hopes; / Its forces have made landings on our globe, / Its signs have stamped their patterns on our lives: / It lends a sovereign movement to our fate, / Its errant waves motive our life’s high surge.

02.06_050:011 - All that we seek for is prefigured there / And all we have not known nor even sought / Which yet one day must be born in human hearts / That the Timeless may fulfil itself in things.

02.06_050:012 - Incarnate in the mystery of the days, / Eternal in an unclosed Infinite, / A mounting endless possibility / Climbs high upon a topless ladder of dream / Forever in the Being’s conscious trance.

02.06_050:013 - All on that ladder mounts to an unseen end.

02.06_050:014 - An Energy of perpetual transience makes / The journey from which no return is sure, / The pilgrimage of Nature to the Unknown.

02.06_050:015 - As if in her ascent to her lost source / She hoped to unroll all that could ever be, / Her high procession moves from stage to stage, / A progress leap from sight to greater sight, / A process march from form to ampler form, / A caravan of the inexhaustible / Formations of a boundless Thought and Force.

02.06_050:016 - Her timeless Power that lay once on the lap / Of a beginningless and endless Calm, / Now severed from the Spirit’s immortal bliss, / Erects the type of all the joys she has lost; / Compelling transient substance into shape, / She hopes by the creative act’s release / To o’erleap sometimes the gulf she cannot fill, / To heal awhile the wound of severance, / Escape from the moment’s prison of littleness / And meet the Eternal’s wide sublimities / In the uncertain time-field portioned here.

02.06_050:017 - Almost she nears what never can be attained; / She shuts eternity into an hour / And fills a little soul with the Infinite; / The Immobile leans to the magic of her call; / She stands on a shore in the Illimitable, / Perceives the formless Dweller in all forms / And feels around her infinity’s embrace.

02.06_050:018 - Her task no ending knows, she serves no aim / But labours driven by a nameless Will / That came from some unknowable formless Vast.

02.06_050:019 - This is her secret and impossible task / To catch the boundless in a net of birth, / To cast the spirit into physical form, / To lend speech and thought to the Ineffable; / She is pushed to reveal the ever Unmanifest.

02.06_050:020 - Yet by her skill the impossible has been done: / She follows her sublime irrational plan, / Invents devices of her magic art / To find new bodies for the Infinite / And images of the Unimaginable; / She has lured the Eternal into the arms of Time.

02.06_050:021 - Even now herself she knows not what she has done.

02.06_050:022 - For all is wrought beneath a baffling mask: / A semblance other than its hidden truth / The aspect wears of an illusion’s trick, / A feigned time-driven unreality, / The unfinished creation of a changing soul / In a body changing with the inhabitant.

02.06_050:023 - Insignificant her means, infinite her work; / On a great field of shapeless consciousness / In little finite strokes of mind and sense / An endless truth she endlessly unfolds; / A timeless mystery works out in Time.

02.06_050:024 - The greatness she has dreamed her acts have missed, / Her labour is a passion and a pain, / A rapture and pang, her glory and her curse; / And yet she cannot choose but labours on; / Her mighty heart forbids her to desist.

02.06_050:025 - As long as the world lasts her failure lives / Astonishing and foiling Reason’s gaze, / A folly and a beauty unspeakable, / A superb madness of the will to live, / A daring, a delirium of delight.

02.06_050:026 - This is her being’s law, its sole resource; / She sates, though satisfaction never comes, / Her hungry will to lavish everywhere / Her many-imaged fictions of the Self / And thousand fashions of one Reality.

02.06_050:027 - A world she made touched by truth’s fleeing hem, / A world cast into a dream of what it seeks, / An icon of truth, a conscious mystery’s shape.

02.06_050:028 - It lingered not like the earth-mind hemmed in / In solid barriers of apparent fact; / It dared to trust the dream-mind and the soul.

02.06_050:029 - A hunter of spiritual verities / Still only thought or guessed or held by faith, / It seized in imagination and confined / A painted bird of paradise in a cage.

02.06_050:030 - This greater life is enamoured of the Unseen; / It calls to some highest Light beyond its reach, / It can feel the Silence that absolves the soul; / It feels a saviour touch, a ray divine: / Beauty and good and truth its godheads are.

02.06_050:031 - It is near to heavenlier heavens than earth’s eyes see, / A direr darkness than man’s life can bear.

02.06_050:032 - It has kinship with the demon and the god.

02.06_050:033 - A strange enthusiasm has moved its heart; / It hungers for heights, it passions for the supreme.

02.06_050:034 - It hunts for the perfect word, the perfect shape, / It leaps to the summit thought, the summit light.

02.06_050:035 - For by the form the Formless is brought close / And all perfection fringes the Absolute.

02.06_050:036 - A child of heaven who never saw his home, / Its impetus meets the eternal at a point: / It can only near and touch, it cannot hold; / It can only strain towards some bright extreme: / Its greatness is to seek and to create.

02.06_050:037 -     On every plane, this Greatness must create.

02.06_050:038 - On earth, in heaven, in hell she is the same; / Of every fate she takes her mighty part.

02.06_050:039 - A guardian of the fire that lights the suns, / She triumphs in her glory and her might: / Opposed, oppressed she bears God’s urge to be born: / The spirit survives upon non-being’s ground, / World-force outlasts world-disillusion’s shock: / Dumb, she is still the Word, inert the Power.

02.06_050:040 - Here fallen, a slave of death and ignorance, / To things deathless she is driven to aspire / And moved to know even the Unknowable.

02.06_050:041 - Even nescient, null, her sleep creates a world.

02.06_050:042 - When most unseen, most mightily she works; / Housed in the atom, buried in the clod / Her quick creative passion cannot cease.

02.06_050:043 - Inconscience is her long gigantic pause, / Her cosmic swoon is a stupendous phase: / Time-born, she hides her immortality; / In death, her bed, she waits the hour to rise.

02.06_050:044 - Even with the Light denied that sent her forth / And the hope dead she needed for her task, / Even when her brightest stars are quenched in Night, / Nourished by hardship and calamity / And with pain for her body’s handmaid, masseuse, nurse, / Her tortured invisible spirit continues still / To toil though in darkness, to create though with pangs; / She carries crucified God upon her breast.

02.06_050:045 - In chill insentient depths where joy is none, / Immured, oppressed by the resisting Void / Where nothing moves and nothing can become, / Still she remembers, still invokes the skill / The Wonder-Worker gave her at her birth, / Imparts to drowsy formlessness a shape, / Reveals a world where nothing was before.

02.06_050:046 - In realms confined to a prone circle of death, / To a dark eternity of Ignorance, / A quiver in an inert inconscient mass, / Or imprisoned in immobilised whorls of Force, / By Matter’s blind compulsion deaf and mute / She reposes motionless in its dust of sleep.

02.06_050:047 - Then, for her rebel waking’s punishment / Given only hard mechanic Circumstance / As the enginery of her magic craft, / She fashions godlike marvels out of mud; / In the plasm she sets her dumb immortal urge, / Helps the live tissue to think, the closed sense to feel, / Flashes through the frail nerves poignant messages, / In a heart of flesh miraculously loves, / To brute bodies gives a soul, a will, a voice.

02.06_050:048 - Ever she summons as by a sorcerer’s wand / Beings and shapes and scenes innumerable, / Torch-bearers of her pomps through Time and Space.

02.06_050:049 - This world is her long journey through the night, / The suns and planets lamps to light her road, / Our reason is the confidante of her thoughts, / Our senses are her vibrant witnesses.

02.06_050:050 - There drawing her signs from things half true, half false, / She labours to replace by realised dreams / The memory of her lost eternity.

02.06_050:051 -     These are her deeds in this huge world-ignorance: / Till the veil is lifted, till the night is dead, / In light or dark she keeps her tireless search; / Time is her road of endless pilgrimage.

02.06_050:052 - One mighty passion motives all her works.

02.06_050:053 - Her eternal Lover is her action’s cause; / For him she leaped forth from the unseen Vasts / To move here in a stark unconscious world.

02.06_050:054 - Its acts are her commerce with her hidden Guest, / His moods she takes for her heart’s passionate moulds; / In beauty she treasures the sunlight of his smile.

02.06_050:055 - Ashamed of her rich cosmic poverty, / She cajoles with her small gifts his mightiness, / Holds with her scenes his look’s fidelity / And woos his large-eyed wandering thoughts to dwell / In figures of her million-impulsed Force.

02.06_050:056 - Only to attract her veiled companion / And keep him close to her breast in her world-cloak / Lest from her arms he turn to his formless peace, / Is her heart’s business and her clinging care.

02.06_050:057 - Yet when he is most near, she feels him far.

02.06_050:058 - For contradiction is her nature’s law.

02.06_050:059 - Although she is ever in him and he in her, / As if unaware of the eternal tie, / Her will is to shut God into her works / And keep him as her cherished prisoner / That never they may part again in Time.

02.06_050:060 - A sumptuous chamber of the Spirit’s sleep / At first she made, a deep interior room, / Where he slumbers as if a forgotten guest.

02.06_050:061 - But now she turns to break the oblivious spell, / Awakes the sleeper on the sculptured couch; / She finds again the Presence in the form / And in the light that wakes with him recovers / A meaning in the hurry and trudge of Time, / And through this mind that once obscured the soul / Passes a glint of unseen deity.

02.06_050:062 - Across a luminous dream of spirit-space / She builds creation like a rainbow bridge / Between the original Silence and the Void.

02.06_050:063 - A net is made of the mobile universe; / She weaves a snare for the conscious Infinite.

02.06_050:064 - A knowledge is with her that conceals its steps / And seems a mute omnipotent Ignorance.

02.06_050:065 - A might is with her that makes wonders true; / The incredible is her stuff of common fact.

02.06_050:066 - Her purposes, her workings riddles prove; / Examined, they grow other than they were, / Explained, they seem yet more inexplicable.

02.06_050:067 - Even in our world a mystery has reigned / Earth’s cunning screen of trivial plainness hides; / Her larger levels are of sorceries made.

02.06_050:068 - There the enigma shows its splendid prism, / There is no deep disguise of commonness; / Occult, profound comes all experience, / Marvel is ever new, miracle divine.

02.06_050:069 - There is a screened burden, a mysterious touch, / There is a secrecy of hidden sense.

02.06_050:070 - Although no earthen mask weighs on her face, / Into herself she flees from her own sight.

02.06_050:071 - All forms are tokens of some veiled idea / Whose covert purpose lurks from mind’s pursuit, / Yet is a womb of sovereign consequence.

02.06_050:072 - There every thought and feeling is an act, / And every act a symbol and a sign, / And every symbol hides a living power.

02.06_050:073 - A universe she builds from truths and myths, / But what she needed most she cannot build; / All shown is a figure or copy of the Truth, / But the Real veils from her its mystic face.

02.06_050:074 - All else she finds, there lacks eternity; / All is sought out but missed the Infinite.


Section I - 51: choose their side


02.06_051:001 - A consciousness lit by a Truth above / Was felt; it saw the light but not the Truth: / It caught the Idea and built from it a world; / It made an Image there and called it God.

02.06_051:002 - Yet something true and inward harboured there.

02.06_051:003 - The beings of that world of greater life, / Tenants of a larger air and freer space, / Live not by the body or in outward things: / A deeper living was their seat of self.

02.06_051:004 - In that intense domain of intimacy / Objects dwell as companions of the soul; / The body’s actions are a minor script, / The surface rendering of a life within.

02.06_051:005 - All forces are Life’s retinue in that world / And thought and body as her handmaids move.

02.06_051:006 - The universal widenesses give her room: / All feel the cosmic movement in their acts / And are the instruments of her cosmic might.

02.06_051:007 - Or their own self they make their universe.

02.06_051:008 - In all who have risen to a greater Life / A voice of unborn things whispers to the ear, / To their eyes visited by some high sunlight / Aspiration shows the image of a crown: / To work out a seed that she has thrown within, / To achieve her power in them her creatures live.

02.06_051:009 - Each is a greatness growing towards the heights / Or from his inner centre oceans out; / In circling ripples of concentric power / They swallow, glutted, their environment.

02.06_051:010 - Even of that largeness many a cabin make; / In narrower breadths and briefer vistas pent / They live content with some small greatness won.

02.06_051:011 - To rule the little empire of themselves, / To be a figure in their private world / And make the milieu’s joys and griefs their own / And satisfy their life-motives and life-wants / Is charge enough and office for this strength, / A steward of the Person and his fate.

02.06_051:012 - This was transition-line and starting-point, / A first immigration into heavenliness, / For all who cross into that brilliant sphere: / These are the kinsmen of our earthly race; / This region borders on our mortal state.

02.06_051:013 - This wider world our greater movements gives, / Its strong formations build our growing selves; / Its creatures are our brighter replicas, / Complete the types we only initiate / And are securely what we strive to be.

02.06_051:014 - As if thought-out eternal characters, / Entire, not pulled as we by contrary tides, / They follow the unseen leader in the heart, / Their lives obey the inner nature’s law.

02.06_051:015 - There is kept grandeur’s store, the hero’s mould; / The soul is the watchful builder of its fate; / None is a spirit indifferent and inert; / They choose their side, they see the god they adore.

02.06_051:016 - A battle is joined between the true and false, / A pilgrimage sets out to the divine Light.

02.06_051:017 - For even Ignorance there aspires to know / And shines with the lustre of a distant star; / There is a knowledge in the heart of sleep / And Nature comes to them as a conscious force.

02.06_051:018 - An ideal is their leader and their king: / Aspiring to the monarchy of the sun / They call in Truth for their high government, / Hold her incarnate in their daily acts / And fill their thoughts with her inspired voice / And shape their lives into her breathing form, / Till in her sun-gold godhead they too share.

02.06_051:019 - Or to the truth of Darkness they subscribe; / Whether for Heaven or Hell they must wage war: / Warriors of Good, they serve a shining cause / Or are Evil’s soldiers in the pay of Sin.

02.06_051:020 - For evil and good an equal tenure keep / Wherever Knowledge is Ignorance’s twin.

02.06_051:021 - All powers of Life towards their godhead tend / In the wideness and the daring of that air, / Each builds its temple and expands its cult, / And Sin too there is a divinity.

02.06_051:022 - Affirming the beauty and splendour of her law / She claims life as her natural domain, / Assumes the world’s throne or dons the papal robe: / Her worshippers proclaim her sacred right.

02.06_051:023 - A red-tiaraed falsehood they revere, / Worship the shadow of a crooked god, / Admit the black Idea that twists the brain / Or lie with the harlot Power that slays the Soul.

02.06_051:024 - A mastering virtue statuesques the pose, / Or a titan passion goads to a proud unrest: / At Wisdom’s altar they are kings and priests / Or their life a sacrifice to an idol of Power.

02.06_051:025 - Or Beauty shines on them like a wandering star; / Too far to reach, passionate they follow her light; / In Art and Life they catch the All-Beautiful’s ray / And make the world their radiant treasure house: / Even common figures are with marvel robed; / A charm and greatness locked in every hour / Awakes the joy which sleeps in all things made.

02.06_051:026 - A mighty victory or a mighty fall, / A throne in heaven or a pit in hell, / The dual Energy they have justified / And marked their souls with her tremendous seal: / Whatever Fate may do to them they have earned; / Something they have done, something they have been, they live.

02.06_051:027 - There Matter is soul’s result and not its cause.

02.06_051:028 - In a contrary balance to earth’s truth of things / The gross weighs less, the subtle counts for more; / On inner values hangs the outer plan.

02.06_051:029 - As quivers with the thought the expressive word, / As yearns the act with the passion of the soul / This world’s apparent sensible design / Looks vibrant back to some interior might.

02.06_051:030 - A Mind not limited by external sense / Gave figures to the spirit’s imponderables, / The world’s impacts without channels registered / And turned into the body’s concrete thrill / The vivid workings of a bodiless Force; / Powers here subliminal that act unseen / Or in ambush crouch waiting behind the wall / Came out in front uncovering their face.

02.06_051:031 - The occult grew there overt, the obvious kept / A covert turn and shouldered the unknown; / The unseen was felt and jostled visible shapes.

02.06_051:032 - In the communion of two meeting minds / Thought looked at thought and had no need of speech; / Emotion clasped emotion in two hearts, / They felt each other’s thrill in the flesh and nerves / Or melted each in each and grew immense / As when two houses burn and fire joins fire: / Hate grappled hate and love broke in on love, / Will wrestled with will on mind’s invisible ground; / Others’ sensations passing through like waves / Left quivering the subtle body’s frame, / Their anger rushed galloping in brute attack, / A charge of trampling hooves on shaken soil; / One felt another’s grief invade the breast, / Another’s joy exulting ran through the blood: / Hearts could draw close through distance, voices near / That spoke upon the shore of alien seas.

02.06_051:033 - There beat a throb of living interchange: / Being felt being even when afar / And consciousness replied to consciousness.

02.06_051:034 - And yet the ultimate oneness was not there.

02.06_051:035 - There was a separateness of soul from soul: / An inner wall of silence could be built, / An armour of conscious might protect and shield; / The being could be closed in and solitary; / One could remain apart in self, alone.

02.06_051:036 - Identity was not yet nor union’s peace.

02.06_051:037 - All was imperfect still, half-known, half-done: / The miracle of Inconscience overpassed, / The miracle of the Superconscient still / Unknown, self-wrapped, unfelt, unknowable, / Looked down on them, origin of all they were.

02.06_051:038 - As forms they came of the formless Infinite, / As names lived of a nameless Eternity.

02.06_051:039 - The beginning and the end were there occult; / A middle term worked unexplained, abrupt: / They were words that spoke to a vast wordless Truth, / They were figures crowding an unfinished sum.

02.06_051:040 - None truly knew himself or knew the world / Or the Reality living there enshrined: / Only they knew what Mind could take and build / Out of the secret Supermind’s huge store.

02.06_051:041 - A darkness under them, a bright Void above, / Uncertain they lived in a great climbing space; / By mysteries they explained a Mystery, / A riddling answer met the riddle of things.

02.06_051:042 - As he moved in this ether of ambiguous life, / Himself he grew a riddle to himself; / As symbols he saw all and sought their sense.



Section I - 52: Ever she circled (looked up to a hidden Sun)


02.06_052:001 - Across the leaping springs of death and birth / And over shifting borders of soul-change, / A hunter on the Spirit’s creative track, / He followed in life’s fine and mighty trails / Pursuing her sealed formidable delight / In a perilous adventure without close.

02.06_052:002 - At first no aim appeared in these large steps: / Only the wide source he saw of all things here / Looking towards a wider source beyond.

02.06_052:003 - For as she drew away from earthly lines, / A tenser drag was felt from the Unknown, / A higher context of delivering thought / Drove her towards marvel and discovery; / There came a high release from pettier cares, / A mightier image of desire and hope, / A vaster formula, a greater scene.

02.06_052:004t - Ever she circled towards some far-off Light: / Her signs still covered more than they revealed; / But tied to some immediate sight and will / They lost their purport in the joy of use, / Till stripped of their infinite meaning they became / A cipher gleaming with unreal sense. #longest-path #loss-of-meaning #surface-consciousness #truth-of-things #veiled-knowledge

02.06_052:005 - Armed with a magical and haunted bow / She aimed at a target kept invisible / And ever deemed remote though always near.

02.06_052:006 - As one who spells illumined characters, / The key-book of a crabbed magician text, / He scanned her subtle tangled weird designs / And the screened difficult theorem of her clues, / Traced in the monstrous sands of desert Time / The thread beginnings of her titan works, / Watched her charade of action for some hint, / Read the No-gestures of her silhouettes, / And strove to capture in their burdened drift / The dance-fantasia of her sequences / Escaping into rhythmic mystery, / A glimmer of fugitive feet on fleeing soil.

02.06_052:007 - In the labyrinth pattern of her thoughts and hopes / And the byways of her intimate desires, / In the complex corners crowded with her dreams / And rounds crossed by an intrigue of irrelevant rounds, / A wanderer straying amid fugitive scenes / He lost its signs and chased each failing guess.

02.06_052:008 - Ever he met key-words, ignorant of their key.

02.06_052:009 - A sun that dazzled its own eye of sight, / A luminous enigma’s brilliant hood / Lit the dense purple barrier of thought’s sky: / A dim large trance showed to the night her stars.

02.06_052:010 - As if sitting near an open window’s gap, / He read by lightning-flash on crowding flash / Chapters of her metaphysical romance / Of the soul’s search for lost Reality / And her fictions drawn from spirit’s authentic fact, / Her caprices and conceits and meanings locked, / Her rash unseizable freaks and mysteried turns.

02.06_052:011 - The magnificent wrappings of her secrecy / That fold her desirable body out of sight, / The strange significant forms woven on her robe, / Her meaningful outlines of the souls of things / He saw, her false transparencies of thought-hue, / Her rich brocades with imaged fancies sewn / And mutable masks and broideries of disguise.

02.06_052:012 - A thousand baffling faces of the Truth / Looked at him from her forms with unknown eyes / And wordless mouths unrecognisable, / Spoke from the figures of her masquerade, / Or peered from the recondite magnificence / And subtle splendour of her draperies.

02.06_052:013 - In sudden scintillations of the unknown, / Inexpressive sounds became veridical, / Ideas that seemed unmeaning flashed out truth; / Voices that came from unseen waiting worlds / Uttered the syllables of the Unmanifest / To clothe the body of the mystic Word, / And wizard diagrams of the occult Law / Sealed some precise unreadable harmony, / Or used hue and figure to reconstitute / The herald blazon of Time’s secret things.

02.06_052:014 - In her green wildernesses and lurking depths, / In her thickets of joy where danger clasps delight, / He glimpsed the hidden wings of her songster hopes, / A glimmer of blue and gold and scarlet fire.

02.06_052:015 - In her covert lanes, bordering her chance field-paths / And by her singing rivulets and calm lakes / He found the glow of her golden fruits of bliss / And the beauty of her flowers of dream and muse.

02.06_052:016 - As if a miracle of heart’s change by joy / He watched in the alchemist radiance of her suns / The crimson outburst of one secular flower / On the tree of sacrifice of spiritual love.

02.06_052:017 - In the sleepy splendour of her noons he saw, / A perpetual repetition through the hours, / Thought’s dance of dragon-flies on mystery’s stream / That skim but never test its murmurs’ race, / And heard the laughter of her rose desires / Running as if to escape from longed-for hands, / Jingling sweet anklet-bells of fantasy.

02.06_052:018 - Amidst live symbols of her occult power / He moved and felt them as close real forms: / In that life more concrete than the lives of men / Throbbed heart-beats of the hidden reality: / Embodied was there what we but think and feel, / Self-framed what here takes outward borrowed shapes.

02.06_052:019 - A comrade of Silence on her austere heights / Accepted by her mighty loneliness, / He stood with her on meditating peaks / Where life and being are a sacrament / Offered to the Reality beyond, / And saw her loose into Infinity / Her hooded eagles of significance, / Messengers of Thought to the Unknowable.

02.06_052:020 - Identified in soul-vision and soul-sense, / Entering into her depths as into a house, / All he became that she was or longed to be, / He thought with her thoughts and journeyed with her steps, / Lived with her breath and scanned all with her eyes / That he might learn the secret of her soul.

02.06_052:021 - A witness overmastered by his scene, / He admired her splendid front of pomp and play / And the marvels of her rich and delicate craft, / And thrilled to the insistence of her cry; / Impassioned he bore the sorceries of her might, / Felt laid on him her abrupt mysterious will, / Her hands that knead fate in their violent grasp, / Her touch that moves, her powers that seize and drive.

02.06_052:022 - But this too he saw, her soul that wept within, / Her seekings vain that clutch at fleeing truth, / Her hopes whose sombre gaze mates with despair, / The passion that possessed her longing limbs, / The trouble and rapture of her yearning breasts, / Her mind that toils unsatisfied with its fruits, / Her heart that captures not the one Beloved.

02.06_052:023 - Always he met a veiled and seeking Force, / An exiled goddess building mimic heavens, / A Sphinx whose eyes look up to a hidden Sun.


Section I - 53: snatches of her felicty


02.06_053:001 - Ever he felt near a spirit in her forms: / Its passive presence was her nature’s strength; / This sole is real in apparent things, / Even upon earth the spirit is life’s key, / But her solid outsides nowhere bear its trace.

02.06_053:002 - Its stamp on her acts is undiscoverable.

02.06_053:003 - A pathos of lost heights is its appeal.

02.06_053:004 - Only sometimes is caught a shadowy line / That seems a hint of veiled reality.

02.06_053:005 - Life stared at him with vague confused outlines / Offering a picture the eyes could not keep, / A story that was yet not written there.

02.06_053:006 - As in a fragmentary half-lost design / Life’s meanings fled from the pursuing eye.

02.06_053:007 - Life’s visage hides life’s real self from sight; / Life’s secret sense is written within, above.

02.06_053:008 - The thought that gives it sense lives far beyond; / It is not seen in its half-finished design.

02.06_053:009 - In vain we hope to read the baffling signs / Or find the word of the half-played charade.

02.06_053:010 - Only in that greater life a cryptic thought / Is found, is hinted some interpreting word / That makes the earth-myth a tale intelligible.

02.06_053:011 - Something was seen at last that looked like truth.

02.06_053:012 - In a half-lit air of hazardous mystery / The eye that looks at the dark half of truth / Made out an image mid a vivid blur / And peering through a mist of subtle tints / He saw a half-blind chained divinity / Bewildered by the world in which he moved, / Yet conscious of some light prompting his soul.

02.06_053:013 - Attracted to strange far-off shimmerings, / Led by the fluting of a distant Player / He sought his way amid life’s laughter and call / And the index chaos of her myriad steps / Towards some total deep infinitude.

02.06_053:014 - Around crowded the forest of her signs: / At hazard he read by arrow-leaps of Thought / That hit the mark by guess or luminous chance, / Her changing coloured road-lights of idea / And her signals of uncertain swift event, / The hieroglyphs of her symbol pageantries / And her landmarks in the tangled paths of Time.

02.06_053:015 - In her mazes of approach and of retreat / To every side she draws him and repels, / But drawn too near escapes from his embrace; / All ways she leads him but no way is sure.

02.06_053:016 - Allured by the many-toned marvel of her chant, / Attracted by the witchcraft of her moods / And moved by her casual touch to joy and grief, / He loses himself in her but wins her not.

02.06_053:017 - A fugitive paradise smiles at him from her eyes: / He dreams of her beauty made for ever his, / He dreams of his mastery her limbs shall bear, / He dreams of the magic of her breasts of bliss.

02.06_053:018 - In her illumined script, her fanciful / Translation of God’s pure original text, / He thinks to read the Scripture Wonderful, / Hieratic key to unknown beatitudes.

02.06_053:019 - But the Word of Life is hidden in its script, / The chant of Life has lost its divine note.

02.06_053:020 - Unseen, a captive in a house of sound, / The spirit lost in the splendour of a dream / Listens to a thousand-voiced illusion’s ode.

02.06_053:021 - A delicate weft of sorcery steals the heart / Or a fiery magic tints her tones and hues, / Yet they but wake a thrill of transient grace; / A vagrant march struck by the wanderer Time / They call to a brief unsatisfied delight / Or wallow in ravishments of mind and sense, / But miss the luminous answer of the soul.

02.06_053:022 - A blind heart-throb that reaches joy through tears, / A yearning towards peaks for ever unreached, / An ecstasy of unfulfilled desire / Track the last heavenward climbings of her voice.

02.06_053:023 - Transmuted are past suffering’s memories / Into an old sadness’s sweet escaping trail: / Turned are her tears to gems of diamond pain, / Her sorrow into a magic crown of song.

02.06_053:024 - Brief are her snatches of felicity / That touch the surface, then escape or die: / A lost remembrance echoes in her depths, / A deathless longing is hers, a veiled self’s call; / A prisoner in the mortal’s limiting world, / A spirit wounded by life sobs in her breast; / A cherished suffering is her deepest cry.

02.06_053:025 - A wanderer on forlorn despairing routes, / Along the roads of sound a frustrate voice / Forsaken cries to a forgotten bliss.

02.06_053:026 - Astray in the echo caverns of Desire, / It guards the phantoms of a soul’s dead hopes / And keeps alive the voice of perished things / Or lingers upon sweet and errant notes / Hunting for pleasure in the heart of pain.

02.06_053:027 - A fateful hand has touched the cosmic chords / And the intrusion of a troubled strain / Covers the inner music’s hidden key / That guides unheard the surface cadences.

02.06_053:028 - Yet is it joy to live and to create / And joy to love and labour though all fails, / And joy to seek though all we find deceives / And all on which we lean betrays our trust; / Yet something in its depths was worth the pain, / A passionate memory haunts with ecstasy’s fire.

02.06_053:029 - Even grief has joy hidden beneath its roots: / For nothing is truly vain the One has made: / In our defeated hearts God’s strength survives / And victory’s star still lights our desperate road; / Our death is made a passage to new worlds.

02.06_053:030 - This to Life’s music gives its anthem swell.

02.06_053:031 - To all she lends the glory of her voice; / Heaven’s raptures whisper to her heart and pass, / Earth’s transient yearnings cry from her lips and fade.

02.06_053:032 - Alone the God-given hymn escapes her art / That came with her from her spiritual home / But stopped half-way and failed, a silent word / Awake in some deep pause of waiting worlds, / A murmur suspended in eternity’s hush: / But no breath comes from the supernal peace: / A sumptuous interlude occupies the ear / And the heart listens and the soul consents; / An evanescent music it repeats / Wasting on transience Time’s eternity.

02.06_053:033 - A tremolo of the voices of the hours / Oblivious screens the high intended theme / The self-embodying spirit came to play / On the vast clavichord of Nature-Force.

02.06_053:034 - Only a mighty murmur here and there / Of the eternal Word, the blissful Voice / Or Beauty’s touch transfiguring heart and sense, / A wandering splendour and a mystic cry, / Recalls the strength and sweetness heard no more.



Section I - 54: half-sight (rekindling faith)


02.06_054:001 - Here is the gap, here stops or sinks life’s force; / This deficit paupers the magician’s skill: / This want makes all the rest seem thin and bare.

02.06_054:002t - A half-sight draws the horizon of her acts: / Her depths remember what she came to do, / But the mind has forgotten or the heart mistakes: / In Nature’s endless lines is lost the God. #divine-destiny #hidden-divinity #limits-of-perception #natures-maze #the-ignorance #truth-within #favorite

02.06_054:003 - In knowledge to sum up omniscience, / In action to erect the Omnipotent, / To create her Creator here was her heart’s conceit, / To invade the cosmic scene with utter God.

02.06_054:004 - Toiling to transform the still far Absolute / Into an all-fulfilling epiphany, / Into an utterance of the Ineffable, / She would bring the glory here of the Absolute’s force, / Change poise into creation’s rhythmic swing, / Marry with a sky of calm a sea of bliss.

02.06_054:005 - A fire to call eternity into Time, / Make body’s joy as vivid as the soul’s, / Earth she would lift to neighbourhood with heaven, / Labours life to equate with the Supreme / And reconcile the Eternal and the Abyss.

02.06_054:006 - Her pragmatism of the transcendent Truth / Fills silence with the voices of the gods, / But in the cry the single Voice is lost.

02.06_054:007 - For Nature’s vision climbs beyond her acts.

02.06_054:008 - A life of gods in heaven she sees above, / A demi-god emerging from an ape / Is all she can in our mortal element.

02.06_054:009 - Here the half-god, the half-titan are her peak: / This greater life wavers twixt earth and sky.

02.06_054:010 - A poignant paradox pursues her dreams: / Her hooded energy moves an ignorant world / To look for a joy her own strong clasp puts off: / In her embrace it cannot turn to its source.

02.06_054:011 - Immense her power, endless her act’s vast drive, / Astray is its significance and lost.

02.06_054:012 - Although she carries in her secret breast / The law and journeying curve of all things born / Her knowledge partial seems, her purpose small; / On a soil of yearning tread her sumptuous hours.

02.06_054:013 - A leaden Nescience weighs the wings of Thought, / Her power oppresses the being with its garbs, / Her action prisons its immortal gaze.

02.06_054:014 - A sense of limit haunts her masteries / And nowhere is assured content or peace: / For all the depth and beauty of her work / A wisdom lacks that sets the spirit free.

02.06_054:015 - An old and faded charm had now her face / And palled for him her quick and curious lore; / His wide soul asked a deeper joy than hers.

02.06_054:016 - Out of her daedal lines he sought escape; / But neither gate of horn nor ivory / He found nor postern of spiritual sight.

02.06_054:017 - There was no issue from that dreamlike space.

02.06_054:018 - Our being must move eternally through Time; / Death helps us not, vain is the hope to cease; / A secret Will compels us to endure.

02.06_054:019 - Our life’s repose is in the Infinite; / It cannot end, its end is Life supreme.

02.06_054:020 - Death is a passage, not the goal of our walk: / Some ancient deep impulsion labours on: / Our souls are dragged as with a hidden leash, / Carried from birth to birth, from world to world, / Our acts prolong after the body’s fall / The old perpetual journey without pause.

02.06_054:021 - No silent peak is found where Time can rest.

02.06_054:022 - This was a magic stream that reached no sea.

02.06_054:023 - However far he went, wherever turned, / The wheel of works ran with him and outstripped; / Always a farther task was left to do.

02.06_054:024 - A beat of action and a cry of search / For ever grew in that unquiet world; / A busy murmur filled the heart of Time.

02.06_054:025 - All was contrivance and unceasing stir.

02.06_054:026 - A hundred ways to live were tried in vain: / A sameness that assumed a thousand forms / Strove to escape from its long monotone / And made new things that soon were like the old.

02.06_054:027 - A curious decoration lured the eye / And novel values furbished ancient themes / To cheat the mind with the idea of change.

02.06_054:028 - A different picture that was still the same / Appeared upon the cosmic vague background.

02.06_054:029 - Only another labyrinthine house / Of creatures and their doings and events, / A city of the traffic of bound souls, / A market of creation and her wares / Was offered to the labouring mind and heart.

02.06_054:030 - A circuit ending where it first began / Is dubbed the forward and eternal march / Of progress on perfection’s unknown road.

02.06_054:031 - Each final scheme leads to a sequel plan.

02.06_054:032 - Yet every new departure seems the last, / Inspired evangel, theory’s ultimate peak, / Proclaiming a panacea for all Time’s ills / Or carrying thought in its ultimate zenith flight / And trumpeting supreme discovery; / Each brief idea, a structure perishable, / Publishes the immortality of its rule, / Its claim to be the perfect form of things, / Truth’s last epitome, Time’s golden best.

02.06_054:033 - But nothing has been achieved of infinite worth: / A world made ever anew, never complete, / Piled always half-attempts on lost attempts / And saw a fragment as the eternal Whole. #favorite

02.06_054:034 - In the aimless mounting total of things done / Existence seemed a vain necessity’s act, / A wrestle of eternal opposites / In a clasped antagonism’s close-locked embrace, / A play without denouement or idea, / A hunger march of lives without a goal, / Or, written on a bare black board of Space, / A futile and recurring sum of souls, / A hope that failed, a light that never shone, / The labour of an unaccomplished Force / Tied to its acts in a dim eternity.

02.06_054:035 - There is no end or none can yet be seen: / Although defeated, life must struggle on; / Always she sees a crown she cannot grasp; / Her eyes are fixed beyond her fallen state.

02.06_054:036 - There quivers still within her breast and ours / A glory that was once and is no more, / Or there calls to us from some unfulfilled beyond / A greatness yet unreached by the halting world.

02.06_054:037 - In a memory behind our mortal sense / A dream persists of larger happier air / Breathing around free hearts of joy and love, / Forgotten by us, immortal in lost Time.

02.06_054:038 - A ghost of bliss pursues her haunted depths; / For she remembers still though now so far / Her realm of golden ease and glad desire / And the beauty and strength and happiness that were hers / In the sweetness of her glowing paradise, / In her kingdom of immortal ecstasy / Half-way between God’s silence and the Abyss.

02.06_054:039 - This knowledge in our hidden parts we keep; / Awake to a vague mystery’s appeal, / We meet a deep unseen Reality / Far truer than the world’s face of present Truth: / We are chased by a self we cannot now recall / And moved by a Spirit we must still become.

02.06_054:040 - As one who has lost the kingdom of his soul, / We look back to some god-phase of our birth / Other than this imperfect creature here / And hope in this or a diviner world / To recover yet from Heaven’s patient guard / What by our mind’s forgetfulness we miss, / Our being’s natural felicity, / Our heart’s delight we have exchanged for grief, / The body’s thrill we bartered for mere pain, / The bliss for which our mortal nature yearns / As yearns an obscure moth to blazing Light.

02.06_054:041 - Our life is a march to a victory never won.

02.06_054:042 - This wave of being longing for delight, / This eager turmoil of unsatisfied strengths, / These long far files of forward-striving hopes / Lift worshipping eyes to the blue Void called heaven / Looking for the golden Hand that never came, / The advent for which all creation waits, / The beautiful visage of Eternity / That shall appear upon the roads of Time.

02.06_054:043A - Yet still to ourselves we say rekindling faith, / “Oh, surely one day he shall come to our cry, / One day he shall create our life anew / And utter the magic formula of peace / And bring perfection to the scheme of things.

02.06_054:044A - One day he shall descend to life and earth, / Leaving the secrecy of the eternal doors, / Into a world that cries to him for help, / And bring the truth that sets the spirit free, / The joy that is the baptism of the soul, / The strength that is the outstretched arm of Love.

02.06_054:045 - One day he shall lift his beauty’s dreadful veil, / Impose delight on the world’s beating heart / And bare his secret body of light and bliss.”

02.06_054:046 - But now we strain to reach an unknown goal: / There is no end of seeking and of birth, / There is no end of dying and return; / The life that wins its aim asks greater aims, / The life that fails and dies must live again; / Till it has found itself it cannot cease.

02.06_054:047 - All must be done for which life and death were made.

02.06_054:048 - But who shall say that even then is rest?

02.06_054:049 - Or there repose and action are the same / In the deep breast of God’s supreme delight.

02.06_054:050 - In a high state where ignorance is no more, / Each movement is a wave of peace and bliss, / Repose God’s motionless creative force, / Action a ripple in the Infinite / And birth a gesture of Eternity.

02.06_054:051 - A sun of transfiguration still can shine / And Night can bare its core of mystic light; / The self-cancelling, self-afflicting paradox / Into a self-luminous mystery might change, / The imbroglio into a joyful miracle.

02.06_054:052 - Then God could be visible here, here take a shape; / Disclosed would be the spirit’s identity; / Life would reveal her true immortal face.

02.06_054:053 - But now a termless labour is her fate: / In its recurrent decimal of events / Birth, death appear as its vibrating points; / The old question-mark margins each finished page, / Each volume of her effort’s history.

02.06_054:054 - A limping Yes through the aeons journeys still / Accompanied by an eternal No.

02.06_054:055 - All seems in vain, yet endless is the game.

02.06_054:056 - Impassive turns the ever-circling Wheel, / Life has no issue, death brings no release.

02.06_054:057 - A prisoner of itself the being lives / And keeps its futile immortality; / Extinction is denied, its sole escape.

02.06_054:058 - An error of the gods has made the world.

02.06_054:059 - Or indifferent the Eternal watches Time.


Canto 7 - 2.7: The Descent into Night

Section I - 55: mask of Night


02.07_055:001 - A mind absolved from life, made calm to know, / A heart divorced from the blindness and the pang, / The seal of tears, the bond of ignorance, / He turned to find that wide world-failure’s cause.

02.07_055:002 - Away he looked from Nature’s visible face / And sent his gaze into the viewless Vast, / The formidable unknown Infinity, / Asleep behind the endless coil of things, / That carries the universe in its timeless breadths / And the ripples of its being are our lives.

02.07_055:003t - The worlds are built by its unconscious Breath / And Matter and Mind are its figures or its powers, / Our waking thoughts the output of its dreams.  #divine-manifestation #divine-origins #divine-powers #dream-reality #hidden-truths #truth-of-things

02.07_055:004 - The veil was rent that covers Nature’s depths: / He saw the fount of the world’s lasting pain / And the mouth of the black pit of Ignorance; / The evil guarded at the roots of life / Raised up its head and looked into his eyes.

02.07_055:005 - On a dim bank where dies subjective Space, / From a stark ridge overlooking all that is, / A tenebrous awakened Nescience, / Her wide blank eyes wondering at Time and Form, / Stared at the inventions of the living Void / And the Abyss whence our beginnings rose.

02.07_055:006 - Behind appeared a grey carved mask of Night / Watching the birth of all created things.

02.07_055:007 - A hidden Puissance conscious of its force, / A vague and lurking Presence everywhere, / A contrary Doom that threatens all things made, / A Death figuring as the dark seed of life, / Seemed to engender and to slay the world.

02.07_055:008 - Then from the sombre mystery of the gulfs / And from the hollow bosom of the Mask / Something crept forth that seemed a shapeless Thought.

02.07_055:009 - A fatal Influence upon creatures stole / Whose lethal touch pursued the immortal spirit, / On life was laid the haunting finger of Death / And overcast with error, grief and pain / The soul’s native will for truth and joy and light.

02.07_055:010 - A deformation coiled that claimed to be / The being’s very turn, Nature’s true drive.

02.07_055:011 - A hostile and perverting Mind at work / In every corner ensconced of conscious life / Corrupted Truth with her own formulas; / Interceptor of the listening of the soul, / Afflicting knowledge with the hue of doubt / It captured the oracles of the occult gods, / Effaced the signposts of Life’s pilgrimage, / Cancelled the firm rock-edicts graved by Time, / And on the foundations of the cosmic Law / Erected its bronze pylons of misrule.

02.07_055:012 - Even Light and Love by that cloaked danger’s spell / Turned from the brilliant nature of the gods / To fallen angels and misleading suns, / Became themselves a danger and a charm, / A perverse sweetness, heaven-born malefice: / Its power could deform divinest things.

02.07_055:013 - A wind of sorrow breathed upon the world; / All thought with falsehood was besieged, all act / Stamped with defect or with frustration’s sign, / All high attempt with failure or vain success, / But none could know the reason of his fall.

02.07_055:014 - The grey Mask whispered and though no sound was heard, / Yet in the ignorant heart a seed was sown / That bore black fruit of suffering, death and bale.

02.07_055:015 - Out of the chill steppes of a bleak Unseen / Invisible, wearing the Night’s grey mask, / Arrived the shadowy dreadful messengers, / Invaders from a dangerous world of power, / Ambassadors of evil’s absolute.

02.07_055:016 - In silence the inaudible voices spoke, / Hands that none saw planted the fatal grain, / No form was seen, yet a dire work was done, / An iron decree in crooked uncials written / Imposed a law of sin and adverse fate.

02.07_055:017 - Life looked at him with changed and sombre eyes: / Her beauty he saw and the yearning heart in things / That with a little happiness is content, / Answering to a small ray of truth or love; / He saw her gold sunlight and her far blue sky, / Her green of leaves and hue and scent of flowers / And the charm of children and the love of friends / And the beauty of women and kindly hearts of men, / But saw too the dreadful Powers that drive her moods / And the anguish she has strewn upon her ways, / Fate waiting on the unseen steps of men / And her evil and sorrow and last gift of death.

02.07_055:018 - A breath of disillusion and decadence / Corrupting watched for Life’s maturity / And made to rot the full grain of the soul: / Progress became a purveyor of Death.

02.07_055:019 - A world that clung to the law of a slain Light / Cherished the putrid corpses of dead truths, / Hailed twisted forms as things free, new and true, / Beauty from ugliness and evil drank / Feeling themselves guests at a banquet of the gods / And tasted corruption like a high-spiced food.

02.07_055:020 - A darkness settled on the heavy air; / It hunted the bright smile from Nature’s lips / And slew the native confidence in her heart / And put fear’s crooked look into her eyes.

02.07_055:021 - The lust that warps the spirit’s natural good / Replaced by a manufactured virtue and vice / The frank spontaneous impulse of the soul: / Afflicting Nature with the dual’s lie, / Their twin values whetted a forbidden zest, / Made evil a relief from spurious good, / The ego battened on righteousness and sin / And each became an instrument of Hell.

02.07_055:022 - In rejected heaps by a monotonous road / The old simple delights were left to lie / On the wasteland of life’s descent to Night.

02.07_055:023 - All glory of life dimmed tarnished into a doubt, / All beauty ended in an aging face; / All power was dubbed a tyranny cursed by God / And Truth a fiction needed by the mind; / The chase of joy was now a tired hunt; / All knowledge was left a questioning Ignorance.



Section I - 56: vast deception


02.07_056:001 - As from a womb obscure he saw emerge / The body and visage of a dark Unseen / Hidden behind the fair outside of life.

02.07_056:002 - Its dangerous commerce is our suffering’s cause.

02.07_056:003 - Its breath is a subtle poison in men’s hearts; / All evil starts from that ambiguous face.

02.07_056:004 - A peril haunted now the common air; / The world grew full of menacing Energies, / And wherever turned for help or hope his eyes, / In field and house, in street and camp and mart, / He met the prowl and stealthy come and go / Of armed disquieting bodied Influences.

02.07_056:005 - A march of goddess figures dark and nude / Alarmed the air with grandiose unease; / Appalling footsteps drew invisibly near, / Shapes that were threats invaded the dream-light, / And ominous beings passed him on the road / Whose very gaze was a calamity: / A charm and sweetness sudden and formidable, / Faces that raised alluring lips and eyes / Approached him armed with beauty like a snare, / But hid a fatal meaning in each line / And could in a moment dangerously change.

02.07_056:006 - But he alone discerned that screened attack.

02.07_056:007 - A veil upon the inner vision lay, / A force was there that hid its dreadful steps; / All was belied, yet thought itself the truth; / All were beset but knew not of the siege: / For none could see the authors of their fall.

02.07_056:008 -     Aware of some dark wisdom still withheld / That was the seal and warrant of this strength, / He followed the track of dim tremendous steps / Returning to the night from which they came.

02.07_056:009 - A tract he reached unbuilt and owned by none: / There all could enter but none stay for long.

02.07_056:010 - It was a no-man’s-land of evil air, / A crowded neighbourhood without one home, / A borderland between the world and hell.

02.07_056:011 - There unreality was Nature’s lord: / It was a space where nothing could be true, / For nothing was what it had claimed to be: / A high appearance wrapped a spacious void.

02.07_056:012 - Yet nothing would confess its own pretence / Even to itself in the ambiguous heart: / A vast deception was the law of things; / Only by that deception they could live.

02.07_056:013 - An unsubstantial Nihil guaranteed / The falsehood of the forms this Nature took / And made them seem awhile to be and live.

02.07_056:014 - A borrowed magic drew them from the Void; / They took a shape and stuff that was not theirs / And showed a colour that they could not keep, / Mirrors to a fantasm of reality.

02.07_056:015 - Each rainbow brilliance was a splendid lie; / A beauty unreal graced a glamour face.

02.07_056:016 - Nothing could be relied on to remain: / Joy nurtured tears and good an evil proved, / But never out of evil one plucked good: / Love ended early in hate, delight killed with pain, / Truth into falsity grew and death ruled life.

02.07_056:017 - A Power that laughed at the mischief of the world, / An irony that joined the world’s contraries / And flung them into each other’s arms to strive, / Put a sardonic rictus on God’s face.

02.07_056:018 - Aloof, its influence entered everywhere / And left a cloven hoof-mark on the breast; / A twisted heart and a strange sombre smile / Mocked at the sinister comedy of life.

02.07_056:019 - Announcing the advent of a perilous Form / An ominous tread softened its dire footfall / That none might understand or be on guard; / None heard until a dreadful grasp was close.

02.07_056:020 - Or else all augured a divine approach, / An air of prophecy felt, a heavenly hope, / Listened for a gospel, watched for a new star.

02.07_056:021 - The Fiend was visible, but cloaked in light; / He seemed a helping angel from the skies: / He armed untruth with Scripture and the Law; / He deceived with wisdom, with virtue slew the soul / And led to perdition by the heavenward path.

02.07_056:022 - A lavish sense he gave of power and joy, / And when arose the warning from within, / He reassured the ear with dulcet tones, / Or took the mind captive in its own net; / His rigorous logic made the false seem true.

02.07_056:023 - Amazing the elect with holy lore / He spoke as with the very voice of God.

02.07_056:024 - The air was full of treachery and ruse; / Truth-speaking was a stratagem in that place; / Ambush lurked in a smile and peril made / Safety its cover, trust its entry’s gate: / Falsehood came laughing with the eyes of truth; / Each friend might turn an enemy or spy, / The hand one clasped ensleeved a dagger’s stab / And an embrace could be Doom’s iron cage.

02.07_056:025 - Agony and danger stalked their trembling prey / And softly spoke as to a timid friend: / Attack sprang suddenly vehement and unseen; / Fear leaped upon the heart at every turn / And cried out with an anguished dreadful voice; / It called for one to save but none came near.

02.07_056:026 - All warily walked, for death was ever close; / Yet caution seemed a vain expense of care, / For all that guarded proved a deadly net, / And when after long suspense salvation came / And brought a glad relief disarming strength, / It served as a smiling passage to worse fate.

02.07_056:027 - There was no truce and no safe place to rest; / One dared not slumber or put off one’s arms: / It was a world of battle and surprise.

02.07_056:028 - All who were there lived for themselves alone; / All warred against all, but with a common hate / Turned on the mind that sought some higher good; / Truth was exiled lest she should dare to speak / And hurt the heart of darkness with her light / Or bring her pride of knowledge to blaspheme / The settled anarchy of established things.



Section I - 57: prayer upon his lips


02.07_057:001 - Then the scene changed, but kept its dreadful core: / Altering its form the life remained the same.

02.07_057:002 - A capital was there without a State: / It had no ruler, only groups that strove.

02.07_057:003 - He saw a city of ancient Ignorance / Founded upon a soil that knew not Light.

02.07_057:004 - There each in his own darkness walked alone: / Only they agreed to differ in Evil’s paths, / To live in their own way for their own selves / Or to enforce a common lie and wrong; / There Ego was lord upon his peacock seat / And falsehood sat by him, his mate and queen: / The world turned to them as Heaven to Truth and God.

02.07_057:005 - Injustice justified by firm decrees / The sovereign weights of Error’s legalised trade, / But all the weights were false and none the same; / Ever she watched with her balance and a sword / Lest any sacrilegious word expose / The sanctified formulas of her old misrule.

02.07_057:006 - In high professions wrapped self-will walked wide / And licence stalked prating of order and right: / There was no altar raised to Liberty; / True freedom was abhorred and hunted down: / Harmony and tolerance nowhere could be seen; / Each group proclaimed its dire and naked Law.

02.07_057:007 - A frame of ethics knobbed with scriptural rules / Or a theory passionately believed and praised / A table seemed of high Heaven’s sacred code.

02.07_057:008 - A formal practice mailed and iron-shod / Gave to a rude and ruthless warrior kind / Drawn from the savage bowels of the earth / A proud stern poise of harsh nobility, / A civic posture rigid and formidable.

02.07_057:009 - But all their private acts belied the pose: / Power and utility were their Truth and Right, / An eagle rapacity clawed its coveted good, / Beaks pecked and talons tore all weaker prey.

02.07_057:010 - In their sweet secrecy of pleasant sins / Nature they obeyed and not a moralist God.

02.07_057:011 - Inconscient traders in bundles of contraries, / They did what in others they would persecute; / When their eyes looked upon their fellow’s vice, / An indignation flamed, a virtuous wrath; / Oblivious of their own deep-hid offence, / Moblike they stoned a neighbour caught in sin.

02.07_057:012 - A pragmatist judge within passed false decrees, / Posed worst iniquities on equity’s base, / Reasoned ill actions just, sanctioned the scale / Of the merchant ego’s interest and desire.

02.07_057:013 - Thus was a balance kept, the world could live.

02.07_057:014 - A zealot fervour pushed their ruthless cults, / All faith not theirs bled scourged as heresy; / They questioned, captived, tortured, burned or smote / And forced the soul to abandon right or die.

02.07_057:015 - Amid her clashing creeds and warring sects / Religion sat upon a blood-stained throne.

02.07_057:016 - A hundred tyrannies oppressed and slew / And founded unity upon fraud and force.

02.07_057:017 - Only what seemed was prized as real there: / The ideal was a cynic ridicule’s butt: / Hooted by the crowd, mocked by enlightened wits, / Spiritual seeking wandered outcasted,— / A dreamer’s self-deceiving web of thought / Or mad chimera deemed or hypocrite’s fake, / Its passionate instinct trailed through minds obscure / Lost in the circuits of the Ignorance.

02.07_057:018 - A lie was there the truth and truth a lie.

02.07_057:019 - Here must the traveller of the upward way— / For daring Hell’s kingdoms winds the heavenly route— / Pause or pass slowly through that perilous space, / A prayer upon his lips and the great Name.

02.07_057:020 - If probed not all discernment’s keen spear-point, / He might stumble into falsity’s endless net.

02.07_057:021 - Over his shoulder often he must look back / Like one who feels on his neck an enemy’s breath; / Else stealing up behind a treasonous blow / Might prostrate cast and pin to unholy soil, / Pierced through his back by Evil’s poignant stake.

02.07_057:022 - So might one fall on the Eternal’s road / Forfeiting the spirit’s lonely chance in Time / And no news of him reach the waiting gods, / Marked “missing” in the register of souls, / His name the index of a failing hope, / The position of a dead remembered star.

02.07_057:023 - Only were safe who kept God in their hearts: / Courage their armour, faith their sword, they must walk, / The hand ready to smite, the eye to scout, / Casting a javelin regard in front, / Heroes and soldiers of the army of Light.

02.07_057:024 - Hardly even so, the grisly danger past, / Released into a calmer purer air, / They dared at length to breathe and smile once more.

02.07_057:025 - Once more they moved beneath a real sun.

02.07_057:026 - Though Hell claimed rule, the spirit still had power.

02.07_057:027 - This No-man’s-land he passed without debate; / Him the heights missioned, him the Abyss desired: / None stood across his way, no voice forbade.

02.07_057:028 - For swift and easy is the downward path, / And now towards the Night was turned his face.



Section I - 58: demonaic wards


02.07_058:001 - A greater darkness waited, a worse reign, / If worse can be where all is evil’s extreme; / Yet to the cloaked the uncloaked is naked worst.

02.07_058:002 - There God and Truth and the supernal Light / Had never been or else had power no more.

02.07_058:003 - As when one slips in a deep moment’s trance / Over mind’s border into another world, / He crossed a boundary whose stealthy trace / Eye could not see but only the soul feel.

02.07_058:004 - Into an armoured fierce domain he came / And saw himself wandering like a lost soul / Amid grimed walls and savage slums of Night.

02.07_058:005 - Around him crowded grey and squalid huts / Neighbouring proud palaces of perverted Power, / Inhuman quarters and demoniac wards.

02.07_058:006 - A pride in evil hugged its wretchedness; / A misery haunting splendour pressed those fell / Dun suburbs of the cities of dream-life.

02.07_058:007 - There Life displayed to the spectator soul / The shadow depths of her strange miracle.

02.07_058:008 - A strong and fallen goddess without hope, / Obscured, deformed by some dire Gorgon spell, / As might a harlot empress in a bouge, / Nude, unashamed, exulting she upraised / Her evil face of perilous beauty and charm / And, drawing panic to a shuddering kiss / Twixt the magnificence of her fatal breasts, / Allured to their abyss the spirit’s fall.

02.07_058:009 - Across the field of sight she multiplied / As on a scenic film or moving plate / The implacable splendour of her nightmare pomps.

02.07_058:010 - On the dark background of a soulless world / She staged between a lurid light and shade / Her dramas of the sorrow of the depths / Written on the agonised nerves of living things: / Epics of horror and grim majesty, / Wry statues spat and stiffened in life’s mud, / A glut of hideous forms and hideous deeds / Paralysed pity in the hardened breast.

02.07_058:011 - In booths of sin and night-repairs of vice / Styled infamies of the body’s concupiscence / And sordid imaginations etched in flesh, / Turned lust into a decorative art: / Abusing Nature’s gift her pervert skill / Immortalised the sown grain of living death, / In a mud goblet poured the bacchic wine, / To a satyr gave the thyrsus of a god.

02.07_058:012 - Impure, sadistic, with grimacing mouths, / Grey foul inventions gruesome and macabre / Came televisioned from the gulfs of Night.

02.07_058:013 - Her craft ingenious in monstrosity, / Impatient of all natural shape and poise, / A gape of nude exaggerated lines, / Gave caricature a stark reality, / And art-parades of weird distorted forms, / And gargoyle masks obscene and terrible / Trampled to tormented postures the torn sense.

02.07_058:014 - An inexorable evil’s worshipper, / She made vileness great and sublimated filth; / A dragon power of reptile energies / And strange epiphanies of grovelling Force / And serpent grandeurs couching in the mire / Drew adoration to a gleam of slime.

02.07_058:015 - All Nature pulled out of her frame and base / Was twisted into an unnatural pose: / Repulsion stimulated inert desire; / Agony was made a red-spiced food for bliss, / Hatred was trusted with the work of lust / And torture took the form of an embrace; / A ritual anguish consecrated death; / Worship was offered to the Undivine.

02.07_058:016 - A new aesthesis of Inferno’s art / That trained the mind to love what the soul hates, / Imposed allegiance on the quivering nerves / And forced the unwilling body to vibrate.

02.07_058:017 - Too sweet and too harmonious to excite / In this regime that soiled the being’s core, / Beauty was banned, the heart’s feeling dulled to sleep / And cherished in their place sensation’s thrills; / The world was probed for jets of sense-appeal.

02.07_058:018 - Here cold material intellect was the judge / And needed sensual prick and jog and lash / That its hard dryness and dead nerves might feel / Some passion and power and acrid point of life.

02.07_058:019 - A new philosophy theorised evil’s rights, / Gloried in the shimmering rot of decadence, / Or gave to a python force persuasive speech / And armed with knowledge the primeval brute.

02.07_058:020 - Over life and Matter only brooding bowed, / Mind changed to the image of a rampant beast; / It scrambled into the pit to dig for truth / And lighted its search with the subconscient’s flares.

02.07_058:021 - Thence bubbling rose sullying the upper air, / The filth and festering secrets of the Abyss: / This it called positive fact and real life.

02.07_058:022 - This now composed the fetid atmosphere.

02.07_058:023 - A wild-beast passion crept from secret Night / To watch its prey with fascinating eyes: / Around him like a fire with sputtering tongues / There lolled and laughed a bestial ecstasy; / The air was packed with longings brute and fierce; / Crowding and stinging in a monstrous swarm / Pressed with a noxious hum into his mind / Thoughts that could poison Nature’s heavenliest breath, / Forcing reluctant lids assailed the sight / Acts that revealed the mystery of Hell.

02.07_058:024 - All that was there was on this pattern made.



Section I - 59: people of the gulfs


02.07_059:001 - A race possessed inhabited those parts.

02.07_059:002 - A force demoniac lurking in man’s depths / That heaves suppressed by the heart’s human law, / Awed by the calm and sovereign eyes of Thought, / Can in a fire and earthquake of the soul / Arise and, calling to its native night, / Overthrow the reason, occupy the life / And stamp its hoof on Nature’s shaking ground: / This was for them their being’s flaming core.

02.07_059:003 - A mighty energy, a monster god, / Hard to the strong, implacable to the weak, / It stared at the harsh unpitying world it made / With the stony eyelids of its fixed idea.

02.07_059:004 - Its heart was drunk with a dire hunger’s wine, / In others’ suffering felt a thrilled delight / And of death and ruin the grandiose music heard.

02.07_059:005 - To have power, to be master, was sole virtue and good: / It claimed the whole world for Evil’s living room, / Its party’s grim totalitarian reign / The cruel destiny of breathing things.

02.07_059:006 - All on one plan was shaped and standardised / Under a dark dictatorship’s breathless weight.

02.07_059:007 - In street and house, in councils and in courts / Beings he met who looked like living men / And climbed in speech upon high wings of thought / But harboured all that is subhuman, vile / And lower than the lowest reptile’s crawl.

02.07_059:008 - The reason meant for nearness to the gods / And uplift to heavenly scale by the touch of mind / Only enhanced by its enlightening ray / Their inborn nature’s wry monstrosity.

02.07_059:009 - Often a familiar visage studying / Joyfully encountered at some dangerous turn, / Hoping to recognise a look of light, / His vision warned by the spirit’s inward eye / Discovered suddenly Hell’s trade-mark there, / Or saw with the inner sense that cannot err, / In the semblance of a fair or virile form / The demon and the goblin and the ghoul.

02.07_059:010 - An insolence reigned of cold stone-hearted strength / Mighty, obeyed, approved by the Titan’s law, / The huge laughter of a giant cruelty / And fierce glad deeds of ogre violence.

02.07_059:011 - In that wide cynic den of thinking beasts / One looked in vain for a trace of pity and love; / There was no touch of sweetness anywhere, / But only Force and its acolytes, greed and hate: / There was no help for suffering, none to save, / None dared resist or speak a noble word.

02.07_059:012 - Armed with the aegis of tyrannic Power, / Signing the edicts of her dreadful rule / And using blood and torture as a seal, / Darkness proclaimed her slogans to the world.

02.07_059:013 - A servile blinkered silence hushed the mind / Or only it repeated lessons taught, / While mitred, holding the good shepherd’s staff, / Falsehood enthroned on awed and prostrate hearts / The cults and creeds that organise living death / And slay the soul on the altar of a lie.

02.07_059:014 - All were deceived or served their own deceit; / Truth in that stifling atmosphere could not live.

02.07_059:015 - There wretchedness believed in its own joy / And fear and weakness hugged their abject depths; / All that is low and sordid-thoughted, base, / All that is drab and poor and miserable, / Breathed in a laxed content its natural air / And felt no yearning of divine release: / Arrogant, gibing at more luminous states / The people of the gulfs despised the sun.

02.07_059:016 - A barriered autarchy excluded light; / Fixed in its will to be its own grey self, / It vaunted its norm unique and splendid type: / It soothed its hunger with a plunderer’s dream; / Flaunting its cross of servitude like a crown, / It clung to its dismal harsh autonomy.

02.07_059:017 - A bull-throat bellowed with its brazen tongue; / Its hard and shameless clamour filling space / And threatening all who dared to listen to truth / Claimed the monopoly of the battered ear; / A deafened acquiescence gave its vote, / And braggart dogmas shouted in the night / Kept for the fallen soul once deemed a god / The pride of its abysmal absolute.



Section I - 60: hope of heaven estranged


02.07_060:001 - A lone discoverer in these menacing realms / Guarded like termite cities from the sun, / Oppressed mid crowd and tramp and noise and flare, / Passing from dusk to deeper dangerous dusk, / He wrestled with powers that snatched from mind its light / And smote from him their clinging influences.

02.07_060:002 - Soon he emerged in a dim wall-less space.

02.07_060:003 - For now the peopled tracts were left behind; / He walked between wide banks of failing eve.

02.07_060:004 - Around him grew a gaunt spiritual blank, / A threatening waste, a sinister loneliness / That left mind bare to an unseen assault, / An empty page on which all that willed could write / Stark monstrous messages without control.

02.07_060:005 - A travelling dot on downward roads of Dusk / Mid barren fields and barns and straggling huts / And a few crooked and phantasmal trees, / He faced a sense of death and conscious Void.

02.07_060:006 - But still a hostile Life unseen was there / Whose deathlike poise resisting light and truth / Made living a bleak gap in nullity.

02.07_060:007 - He heard the grisly voices that deny; / Assailed by thoughts that swarmed like spectral hordes, / A prey to the staring phantoms of the gloom / And terror approaching with its lethal mouth, / Driven by a strange will down ever down, / The sky above a communiqué of Doom, / He strove to shield his spirit from despair, / But felt the horror of the growing Night / And the Abyss rising to claim his soul.

02.07_060:008 - Then ceased the abodes of creatures and their forms / And solitude wrapped him in its voiceless folds.

02.07_060:009 - All vanished suddenly like a thought expunged; / His spirit became an empty listening gulf / Void of the dead illusion of a world: / Nothing was left, not even an evil face; / He was alone with the grey python Night.

02.07_060:010 - A dense and nameless Nothing conscious, mute, / Which seemed alive but without body or mind, / Lusted all being to annihilate / That it might be for ever nude and sole.

02.07_060:011 - As in a shapeless beast’s intangible jaws, / Gripped, strangled by that lusting, viscous blot, / Attracted to some black and giant mouth / And swallowing throat and a huge belly of doom, / His being from its own vision disappeared / Drawn towards depths that hungered for its fall.

02.07_060:012 - A formless void suppressed his struggling brain, / A darkness grim and cold oppressed his flesh, / A whispered grey suggestion chilled his heart; / Haled by a serpent-force from its warm home / And dragged to extinction in blank vacancy / Life clung to its seat with cords of gasping breath; / Lapped was his body by a tenebrous tongue.

02.07_060:013 - Existence smothered travailed to survive; / Hope strangled perished in his empty soul, / Belief and memory abolished died / And all that helps the spirit in its course.

02.07_060:014 - There crawled through every tense and aching nerve / Leaving behind its poignant quaking trail / A nameless and unutterable fear.

02.07_060:015 - As a sea nears a victim bound and still, / The approach alarmed his mind for ever dumb / Of an implacable eternity / Of pain inhuman and intolerable.

02.07_060:016 - This he must bear, his hope of heaven estranged; / He must ever exist without extinction’s peace / In a slow suffering Time and tortured Space, / An anguished nothingness his endless state.

02.07_060:017 - A lifeless vacancy was now his breast, / And in the place where once was luminous thought, / Only remained like a pale motionless ghost / An incapacity for faith and hope / And the dread conviction of a vanquished soul / Immortal still but with its godhead lost, / Self lost and God and touch of happier worlds.

02.07_060:018 - But he endured, stilled the vain terror, bore / The smothering coils of agony and affright; / Then peace returned and the soul’s sovereign gaze.

02.07_060:019 - To the blank horror a calm Light replied: / Immutable, undying and unborn, / Mighty and mute the Godhead in him woke / And faced the pain and danger of the world.

02.07_060:020 - He mastered the tides of Nature with a look: / He met with his bare spirit naked Hell.


Canto 8 - 2.8: The World of Falsehood

Section I - 61: hidden heart of Night


02.08_061:001 - Then could he see the hidden heart of Night: / The labour of its stark unconsciousness / Revealed the endless terrible Inane.

02.08_061:002 - A spiritless blank Infinity was there; / A Nature that denied the eternal Truth / In the vain braggart freedom of its thought / Hoped to abolish God and reign alone.

02.08_061:003 - There was no sovereign Guest, no witness Light; / Unhelped it would create its own bleak world.

02.08_061:004 - Its large blind eyes looked out on demon acts, / Its deaf ears heard the untruth its dumb lips spoke; / Its huge misguided fancy took vast shapes, / Its mindless sentience quivered with fierce conceits; / Engendering a brute principle of life / Evil and pain begot a monstrous soul.

02.08_061:005 - The Anarchs of the formless depths arose, / Great titan beings and demoniac powers, / World-egos racked with lust and thought and will, / Vast minds and lives without a spirit within: / Impatient architects of error’s house, / Leaders of the cosmic ignorance and unrest / And sponsors of sorrow and mortality / Embodied the dark Ideas of the Abyss.

02.08_061:006 - A shadow substance into emptiness came, / Dim forms were born in the unthinking Void / And eddies met and made an adverse Space / In whose black folds Being imagined Hell.

02.08_061:007 - His eyes piercing the triple-plated gloom / Identified their sight with its blind stare: / Accustomed to the unnatural dark, they saw / Unreality made real and conscious Night.

02.08_061:008 - A violent, fierce and formidable world, / An ancient womb of huge calamitous dreams, / Coiled like a larva in the obscurity / That keeps it from the spear-points of Heaven’s stars.

02.08_061:009 - It was the gate of a false Infinite, / An eternity of disastrous absolutes, / An immense negation of spiritual things.

02.08_061:010 - All once self-luminous in the spirit’s sphere / Turned now into their own dark contraries: / Being collapsed into a pointless void / That yet was a zero parent of the worlds; / Inconscience swallowing up the cosmic Mind / Produced a universe from its lethal sleep; / Bliss into black coma fallen, insensible, / Coiled back to itself and God’s eternal joy / Through a false poignant figure of grief and pain / Still dolorously nailed upon a cross / Fixed in the soil of a dumb insentient world / Where birth was a pang and death an agony, / Lest all too soon should change again to bliss.

02.08_061:011 - Thought sat, a priestess of Perversity, / On her black tripod of the triune Snake / Reading by opposite signs the eternal script, / A sorceress reversing Life’s God-frame.

02.08_061:012 - In darkling aisles with evil eyes for lamps / And fatal voices chanting from the apse, / In strange infernal dim basilicas / Intoning the magic of the unholy Word, / The ominous profound Initiate / Performed the ritual of her mysteries.

02.08_061:013 - There suffering was Nature’s daily food / Alluring to the anguished heart and flesh, / And torture was the formula of delight, / Pain mimicked the celestial ecstasy.

02.08_061:014 - There Good, a faithless gardener of God, / Watered with virtue the world’s upas-tree / And, careful of the outward word and act, / Engrafted his hypocrite blooms on native ill.

02.08_061:015 - All high things served their nether opposite: / The forms of Gods sustained a demon cult; / Heaven’s face became a mask and snare of Hell.

02.08_061:016 - There in the heart of vain phenomenon, / In an enormous action’s writhen core / He saw a shape illimitable and vague / Sitting on Death who swallows all things born.

02.08_061:017 - A chill fixed face with dire and motionless eyes, / Her dreadful strident in her shadowy hand / Outstretched, she pierced all creatures with one fate.



Section I - 62: perishes to God and Light


02.08_062:001 - When nothing was save Matter without soul / And a spiritless hollow was the heart of Time, / Then Life first touched the insensible Abyss; / Awaking the stark Void to hope and grief / Her pallid beam smote the unfathomed Night / In which God hid himself from his own view.

02.08_062:002 - In all things she sought their slumbering mystic truth, / The unspoken Word that inspires unconscious forms; / She groped in his deeps for an invisible Law, / Fumbled in the dim subconscient for his mind / And strove to find a way for spirit to be.

02.08_062:003 - But from the Night another answer came.

02.08_062:004 - A seed was in that nether matrix cast, / A dumb unprobed husk of perverted truth, / A cell of an insentient infinite.

02.08_062:005 - A monstrous birth prepared its cosmic form / In Nature’s titan embryo, Ignorance.

02.08_062:006 - Then in a fatal and stupendous hour / Something that sprang from the stark Inconscient’s sleep / Unwillingly begotten by the mute Void, / Lifted its ominous head against the stars; / Overshadowing earth with its huge body of Doom / It chilled the heavens with the menace of a face.

02.08_062:007 - A nameless Power, a shadowy Will arose / Immense and alien to our universe.

02.08_062:008 - In the inconceivable Purpose none can gauge / A vast Non-Being robed itself with shape, / The boundless Nescience of the unconscious depths / Covered eternity with Nothingness.

02.08_062:009 - A seeking Mind replaced the seeing Soul: / Life grew into a huge and hungry death, / The Spirit’s bliss was changed to cosmic pain.

02.08_062:010 - Assuring God’s self-cowled neutrality / A mighty opposition conquered Space.

02.08_062:011 - A sovereign ruling falsehood, death and grief, / It pressed its fierce hegemony on earth; / Disharmonising the original style / Of the architecture of her fate’s design, / It falsified the primal cosmic Will / And bound to struggle and dread vicissitudes / The long slow process of the patient Power.

02.08_062:012 - Implanting error in the stuff of things / It made an Ignorance of the all-wise Law; / It baffled the sure touch of life’s hid sense, / Kept dumb the intuitive guide in Matter’s sleep, / Deformed the insect’s instinct and the brute’s, / Disfigured man’s thought-born humanity.

02.08_062:013 - A shadow fell across the simple Ray: / Obscured was the Truth-light in the cavern heart / That burns unwitnessed in the altar crypt / Behind the still velamen’s secrecy / Companioning the Godhead of the shrine.

02.08_062:014 - Thus was the dire antagonist Energy born / Who mimes the eternal Mother’s mighty shape / And mocks her luminous infinity / With a grey distorted silhouette in the Night.

02.08_062:015 - Arresting the passion of the climbing soul, / She forced on life a slow and faltering pace; / Her hand’s deflecting and retarding weight / Is laid on the mystic evolution’s curve: / The tortuous line of her deceiving mind / The Gods see not and man is impotent; / Oppressing the God-spark within the soul / She forces back to the beast the human fall.

02.08_062:016 - Yet in her formidable instinctive mind / She feels the One grow in the heart of Time / And sees the Immortal shine through the human mould.

02.08_062:017 - Alarmed for her rule and full of fear and rage / She prowls around each light that gleams through the dark / Casting its ray from the Spirit’s lonely tent, / Hoping to enter with fierce stealthy tread / And in the cradle slay the divine Child.

02.08_062:018 - Incalculable are her strength and ruse, / Her touch is a fascination and a death; / She kills her victim with his own delight; / Even Good she makes a hook to drag to Hell.

02.08_062:019 - For her the world runs to its agony.

02.08_062:020 - Often the pilgrim on the Eternal’s road / Ill-lit from clouds by the pale moon of Mind, / Or in devious by-ways wandering alone, / Or lost in deserts where no path is seen, / Falls overpowered by her lion leap, / A conquered captive under her dreadful paws.

02.08_062:021 - Intoxicated by a burning breath / And amorous groan of a destroying mouth, / Once a companion of the sacred Fire, / The mortal perishes to God and Light, / An adversary governs heart and brain, / A Nature hostile to the Mother-force.

02.08_062:022 - The self of life yields up its instruments / To Titan and demoniac agencies / That aggrandise earth-nature and disframe: / A cowled fifth-columnist is now thought’s guide; / His subtle defeatist murmur slays the faith / And, lodged in the breast or whispering from outside, / A lying inspiration fell and dark / A new order substitutes for the divine.

02.08_062:023 - A silence falls upon the spirit’s heights, / From the veiled sanctuary the God retires, / Empty and cold is the chamber of the Bride; / The golden Nimbus now is seen no more, / No longer burns the white spiritual ray / And hushed for ever is the secret Voice.

02.08_062:024 - Then by the Angel of the Vigil Tower / A name is struck from the recording book; / A flame that sang in Heaven sinks quenched and mute, / In ruin ends the epic of a soul.

02.08_062:025 - This is the tragedy of the inner death / When forfeited is the divine element / And only a mind and body live to die.



Section I - giants sons of darkness


02.08_063:001 - For terrible agencies the Spirit allows / And there are subtle and enormous Powers / That shield themselves with the covering Ignorance.

02.08_063:002 - Offspring of the gulfs, agents of the shadowy Force, / Haters of light, intolerant of peace, / Aping to the thought the shining Friend and Guide, / Opposing in the heart the eternal Will, / They veil the occult, uplifting Harmonist.

02.08_063:003 - His wisdom’s oracles are made our bonds; / The doors of God they have locked with keys of creed / And shut out by the Law his tireless Grace.

02.08_063:004 - Along all Nature’s lines they have set their posts / And intercept the caravans of Light; / Wherever the Gods act, they intervene.

02.08_063:005 - A yoke is laid upon the world’s dim heart; / Masked are its beats from the supernal Bliss, / And the closed peripheries of brilliant Mind / Block the fine entries of celestial Fire.

02.08_063:006 - Always the dark Adventurers seem to win; / Nature they fill with evil’s institutes, / Turn into defeats the victories of Truth, / Proclaim as falsehoods the eternal laws, / And load the dice of Doom with wizard lies; / The world’s shrines they have occupied, usurped its thrones.

02.08_063:007 - In scorn of the dwindling chances of the Gods / They claim creation as their conquered fief / And crown themselves the iron Lords of Time.

02.08_063:008 - Adepts of the illusion and the mask, / The artificers of Nature’s fall and pain / Have built their altars of triumphant Night / In the clay temple of terrestrial life.

02.08_063:009 - In the vacant precincts of the sacred Fire, / In front of the reredos in the mystic rite / Facing the dim velamen none can pierce, / Intones his solemn hymn the mitred priest / Invoking their dreadful presence in his breast: / Attributing to them the awful Name / He chants the syllables of the magic text / And summons the unseen communion’s act, / While twixt the incense and the muttered prayer / All the fierce bale with which the world is racked / Is mixed in the foaming chalice of man’s heart / And poured to them like sacramental wine.

02.08_063:010 - Assuming names divine they guide and rule.

02.08_063:011 - Opponents of the Highest they have come / Out of their world of soulless thought and power / To serve by enmity the cosmic scheme.

02.08_063:012 - Night is their refuge and strategic base.

02.08_063:013 - Against the sword of Flame, the luminous Eye, / Bastioned they live in massive forts of gloom, / Calm and secure in sunless privacy: / No wandering ray of Heaven can enter there.

02.08_063:014 - Armoured, protected by their lethal masks, / As in a studio of creative Death / The giant sons of Darkness sit and plan / The drama of the earth, their tragic stage.

02.08_063:015 - All who would raise the fallen world must come / Under the dangerous arches of their power; / For even the radiant children of the gods / To darken their privilege is and dreadful right.

02.08_063:016 - None can reach heaven who has not passed through hell.



Section I - 64: Eternals shadowy veil


02.08_064:001 - This too the traveller of the worlds must dare.

02.08_064:002 - A warrior in the dateless duel’s strife, / He entered into dumb despairing Night / Challenging the darkness with his luminous soul.

02.08_064:003 - Alarming with his steps the threshold gloom / He came into a fierce and dolorous realm / Peopled by souls who never had tasted bliss; / Ignorant like men born blind who know not light, / They could equate worst ill with highest good, / Virtue was to their eyes a face of sin / And evil and misery were their natural state.

02.08_064:004 - A dire administration’s penal code / Making of grief and pain the common law, / Decreeing universal joylessness / Had changed life into a stoic sacrament / And torture into a daily festival.

02.08_064:005 - An act was passed to chastise happiness; / Laughter and pleasure were banned as deadly sins: / A questionless mind was ranked as wise content, / A dull heart’s silent apathy as peace: / Sleep was not there, torpor was the sole rest, / Death came but neither respite gave nor end; / Always the soul lived on and suffered more.

02.08_064:006 - Ever he deeper probed that kingdom of pain; / Around him grew the terror of a world / Of agony followed by worse agony, / And in the terror a great wicked joy / Glad of one’s own and others’ calamity.

02.08_064:007 - There thought and life were a long punishment, / The breath a burden and all hope a scourge, / The body a field of torment, a massed unease; / Repose was a waiting between pang and pang.

02.08_064:008 - This was the law of things none dreamed to change: / A hard sombre heart, a harsh unsmiling mind / Rejected happiness like a cloying sweet; / Tranquillity was a tedium and ennui: / Only by suffering life grew colourful; / It needed the spice of pain, the salt of tears.

02.08_064:009 - If one could cease to be, all would be well; / Else only fierce sensations gave some zest: / A fury of jealousy burning the gnawed heart, / The sting of murderous spite and hate and lust, / The whisper that lures to the pit and treachery’s stroke / Threw vivid spots on the dull aching hours.

02.08_064:010 - To watch the drama of infelicity, / The writhing of creatures under the harrow of doom / And sorrow’s tragic gaze into the night / And horror and the hammering heart of fear / Were the ingredients in Time’s heavy cup / That pleased and helped to enjoy its bitter taste.

02.08_064:011 - Of such fierce stuff was made up life’s long hell: / These were the threads of the dark spider’s web / In which the soul was caught, quivering and wrapt; / This was religion, this was Nature’s rule.

02.08_064:012 - In a fell chapel of iniquity / To worship a black pitiless image of Power / Kneeling one must cross hard-hearted stony courts, / A pavement like a floor of evil fate.

02.08_064:013 - Each stone was a keen edge of ruthless force / And glued with the chilled blood from tortured breasts; / The dry gnarled trees stood up like dying men / Stiffened into a pose of agony, / And from each window peered an ominous priest / Chanting Te Deums for slaughter’s crowning grace, / Cities uprooted, blasted human homes, / Burned writhen bodies, the bombshell’s massacre.

02.08_064:014 - “Our enemies are fallen, are fallen”, they sang, / “All who once stayed our will are smitten and dead; / How great we are, how merciful art Thou.”

02.08_064:015 - Thus thought they to reach God’s impassive throne / And Him command whom all their acts opposed, / Magnifying their deeds to touch his skies, / And make him an accomplice of their crimes.

02.08_064:016 - There no relenting pity could have place, / But ruthless strength and iron moods had sway, / A dateless sovereignty of terror and gloom: / This took the figure of a darkened God / Revered by the racked wretchedness he had made, / Who held in thrall a miserable world, / And helpless hearts nailed to unceasing woe / Adored the feet that trampled them into mire.

02.08_064:017 - It was a world of sorrow and of hate, / Sorrow with hatred for its lonely joy, / Hatred with others’ sorrow as its feast; / A bitter rictus curled the suffering mouth; / A tragic cruelty saw its ominous chance.

02.08_064:018 - Hate was the black archangel of that realm; / It glowed, a sombre jewel in the heart / Burning the soul with its malignant rays, / And wallowed in its fell abysm of might.

02.08_064:019 - These passions even objects seemed to exude,— / For mind overflowed into the inanimate / That answered with the wickedness it received,— / Against their users used malignant powers, / Hurt without hands and strangely, suddenly slew, / Appointed as instruments of an unseen doom.

02.08_064:020 - Or they made themselves a fateful prison wall / Where men condemned wake through the creeping hours / Counted by the tollings of an ominous bell.

02.08_064:021 - An evil environment worsened evil souls: / All things were conscious there and all perverse.

02.08_064:022 - In this infernal realm he dared to press / Even into its deepest pit and darkest core, / Perturbed its tenebrous base, dared to contest / Its ancient privileged right and absolute force: / In Night he plunged to know her dreadful heart, / In Hell he sought the root and cause of Hell.

02.08_064:023 - Its anguished gulfs opened in his own breast; / He listened to clamours of its crowded pain, / The heart-beats of its fatal loneliness.

02.08_064:024 - Above was a chill deaf eternity.

02.08_064:025 - In vague tremendous passages of Doom / He heard the goblin voice that guides to slay, / And faced the enchantments of the demon Sign, / And traversed the ambush of the opponent Snake.

02.08_064:026 - In menacing tracts, in tortured solitudes / Companionless he roamed through desolate ways / Where the red Wolf waits by the fordless stream / And Death’s black eagles scream to the precipice, / And met the hounds of bale who hunt men’s hearts / Baying across the veldts of Destiny, / In footless battlefields of the Abyss / Fought shadowy combats in mute eyeless depths, / Assaults of Hell endured and Titan strokes / And bore the fierce inner wounds that are slow to heal.

02.08_064:027 - A prisoner of a hooded magic Force, / Captured and trailed in Falsehood’s lethal net / And often strangled in the noose of grief, / Or cast on the grim morass of swallowing doubt, / Or shut into pits of error and despair, / He drank her poison draughts till none was left.

02.08_064:028 - In a world where neither hope nor joy could come / The ordeal he suffered of evil’s absolute reign, / Yet kept intact his spirit’s radiant truth.

02.08_064:029 - Incapable of motion or of force, / In Matter’s blank denial gaoled and blind, / Pinned to the black inertia of our base / He treasured between his hands his flickering soul.

02.08_064:030 - His being ventured into mindless Void, / Intolerant gulfs that knew not thought nor sense; / Thought ceased, sense failed, his soul still saw and knew.

02.08_064:031 - In atomic parcellings of the Infinite / Near to the dumb beginnings of lost Self, / He felt the curious small futility / Of the creation of material things.

02.08_064:032 - Or, stifled in the Inconscient’s hollow dusk, / He sounded the mystery dark and bottomless / Of the enormous and unmeaning deeps / Whence struggling life in a dead universe rose.

02.08_064:033 - There in the stark identity lost by mind / He felt the sealed sense of the insensible world / And a mute wisdom in the unknowing Night.

02.08_064:034 - Into the abysmal secrecy he came / Where darkness peers from her mattress, grey and nude / And stood on the last locked subconscient’s floor / Where Being slept unconscious of its thoughts / And built the world not knowing what it built.

02.08_064:035 - There waiting its hour the future lay unknown, / There is the record of the vanished stars.

02.08_064:036 - There in the slumber of the cosmic Will / He saw the secret key of Nature’s change.

02.08_064:037 - A light was with him, an invisible hand / Was laid upon the error and the pain / Till it became a quivering ecstasy, / The shock of sweetness of an arm’s embrace.

02.08_064:038 - He saw in Night the Eternal’s shadowy veil, / Knew death for a cellar of the house of life, / In destruction felt creation’s hasty pace, / Knew loss as the price of a celestial gain / And hell as a short cut to heaven’s gates.

02.08_064:039 - Then in Illusion’s occult factory / And in the Inconscient’s magic printing house / Torn were the formats of the primal Night / And shattered the stereotypes of Ignorance.

02.08_064:040 - Alive, breathing a deep spiritual breath, / Nature expunged her stiff mechanical code / And the articles of the bound soul’s contract, / Falsehood gave back to Truth her tortured shape.

02.08_064:041 - Annulled were the tables of the law of pain, / And in their place grew luminous characters.

02.08_064:042 - The skilful Penman’s unseen finger wrote / His swift intuitive calligraphy; / Earth’s forms were made his divine documents, / The wisdom embodied mind could not reveal, / Inconscience chased from the world’s voiceless breast; / Transfigured were the fixed schemes of reasoning Thought.

02.08_064:043 - Arousing consciousness in things inert, / He imposed upon dark atom and dumb mass / The diamond script of the Imperishable, / Inscribed on the dim heart of fallen things / A paean-song of the free Infinite / And the Name, foundation of eternity, / And traced on the awake exultant cells / In the ideographs of the Ineffable / The lyric of the love that waits through Time / And the mystic volume of the Book of Bliss / And the message of the superconscient Fire.

02.08_064:044 - Then Life beat pure in the corporeal frame; / The infernal Gleam died and could slay no more.

02.08_064:045 - Hell split across its huge abrupt façade / As if a magic building were undone, / Night opened and vanished like a gulf of dream.

02.08_064:046 - Into being’s gap scooped out as empty Space / In which she has filled the place of absent God, / There poured a wide intimate and blissful Dawn, / Healed were all things that Time’s torn heart had made / And sorrow could live no more in Nature’s breast: / Division ceased to be, for God was there.

02.08_064:047 - The soul lit the conscious body with its ray, / Matter and Spirit mingled and were one.


Canto 9 - 2.9: The Paradise of the Life-Gods

Section I - 65: forms that divinise


02.09_065:001 - Around him shone a great felicitous Day.

02.09_065:002 - A lustre of some rapturous Infinite, / It held in the splendour of its golden laugh / Regions of the heart’s happiness set free, / Intoxicated with the wine of God, / Immersed in light, perpetually divine.

02.09_065:003 - A favourite and intimate of the Gods / Obeying the divine command to joy, / It was the sovereign of its own delight / And master of the kingdoms of its force.

02.09_065:004 - Assured of the bliss for which all forms were made, / Unmoved by fear and grief and the shocks of Fate / And unalarmed by the breath of fleeting Time / And unbesieged by adverse circumstance, / It breathed in a sweet secure unguarded ease / Free from our body’s frailty inviting death, / Far from our danger zone of stumbling Will.

02.09_065:005 - It needed not to curb its passionate beats; / Thrilled by the clasp of the warm satisfied sense / And the swift wonder-rush and flame and cry / Of the life-impulse’s red magnificent race, / It lived in a jewel-rhythm of the laughter of God / And lay on the breast of universal love.

02.09_065:006 - Immune the unfettered Spirit of Delight / Pastured his gleaming sun-herds and moon-flocks / Along the lyric speed of griefless streams / In fragrance of the unearthly asphodel.

02.09_065:007 - A silence of felicity wrapped the heavens, / A ceaseless radiance smiled upon the heights; / A murmur of inarticulate ravishment / Trembled in the winds and touched the enchanted soil; / Incessant in the arms of ecstasy / Repeating its sweet involuntary note / A sob of rapture flowed along the hours.

02.09_065:008 - Advancing under an arch of glory and peace, / Traveller on plateau and on musing ridge, / As one who sees in the World-Magician’s glass / A miracled imagery of soul-scapes flee / He traversed scenes of an immortal joy / And gazed into abysms of beauty and bliss.

02.09_065:009 - Around him was a light of conscious suns / And a brooding gladness of great symbol things; / To meet him crowded plains of brilliant calm, / Mountains and violet valleys of the Blest, / Deep glens of joy and crooning waterfalls / And woods of quivering purple solitude; / Below him lay like gleaming jewelled thoughts / Rapt dreaming cities of Gandharva kings.

02.09_065:010 - Across the vibrant secrecies of Space / A dim and happy music sweetly stole, / Smitten by unseen hands he heard heart-close / The harp’s cry of the heavenly minstrels pass, / And voices of unearthly melody / Chanted the glory of eternal love / In the white-blue moonbeam air of Paradise.

02.09_065:011 - A summit and core of all that marvellous world, / Apart stood high Elysian nameless hills, / Burning like sunsets in a trance of eve.

02.09_065:012 - As if to some new unsearched profundity, / Into a joyful stillness plunged their base; / Their slopes through a hurry of laughter and voices sank, / Crossed by a throng of singing rivulets, / Adoring blue heaven with their happy hymn, / Down into woods of shadowy secrecy: / Lifted into wide voiceless mystery / Their peaks climbed towards a greatness beyond life.

02.09_065:013 - The shining Edens of the vital gods / Received him in their deathless harmonies.

02.09_065:014 - All things were perfect there that flower in Time; / Beauty was there creation’s native mould, / Peace was a thrilled voluptuous purity.

02.09_065:015 - There Love fulfilled her gold and roseate dreams / And Strength her crowned and mighty reveries; / Desire climbed up, a swift omnipotent flame, / And Pleasure had the stature of the gods; / Dream walked along the highway of the stars; / Sweet common things turned into miracles: / Overtaken by the spirit’s sudden spell, / Smitten by a divine passion’s alchemy, / Pain’s self compelled transformed to potent joy / Curing the antithesis between heaven and hell.

02.09_065:016 - All life’s high visions are embodied there, / Her wandering hopes achieved, her aureate combs / Caught by the honey-eater’s darting tongue, / Her burning guesses changed to ecstasied truths, / Her mighty pantings stilled in deathless calm / And liberated her immense desires.

02.09_065:017 - In that Paradise of perfect heart and sense / No lower note could break the endless charm / Of her sweetness ardent and immaculate; / Her steps are sure of their intuitive fall.

02.09_065:018 - After the anguish of the soul’s long strife / At length were found calm and celestial rest / And, lapped in a magic flood of sorrowless hours, / Healed were his warrior nature’s wounded limbs / In the encircling arms of Energies / That brooked no stain and feared not their own bliss.

02.09_065:019 - In scenes forbidden to our pallid sense / Amid miraculous scents and wonder-hues / He met the forms that divinise the sight, / To music that can immortalise the mind / And make the heart wide as infinity / Listened, and captured the inaudible / Cadences that awake the occult ear: / Out of the ineffable hush it hears them come / Trembling with the beauty of a wordless speech, / And thoughts too great and deep to find a voice, / Thoughts whose desire new-makes the universe.

02.09_065:020 - A scale of sense that climbed with fiery feet / To heights of unimagined happiness, / Recast his being’s aura in joy-glow, / His body glimmered like a skyey shell; / His gates to the world were swept with seas of light.

02.09_065:021 - His earth, dowered with celestial competence, / Harboured a power that needed now no more / To cross the closed customs-line of mind and flesh / And smuggle godhead into humanity.

02.09_065:022 - It shrank no more from the supreme demand / Of an untired capacity for bliss, / A might that could explore its own infinite / And beauty and passion and the depth’s reply / Nor feared the swoon of glad identity / Where spirit and flesh in inner ecstasy join / Annulling the quarrel between self and shape.

02.09_065:023 - It drew from sight and sound spiritual power, / Made sense a road to reach the intangible: / It thrilled with the supernal influences / That build the substance of life’s deeper soul.

02.09_065:024 - Earth-nature stood reborn, comrade of heaven.

02.09_065:025 - A fit companion of the timeless Kings, / Equalled with the godheads of the living Suns, / He mixed in the radiant pastimes of the Unborn, / Heard whispers of the Player never seen / And listened to his voice that steals the heart / And draws it to the breast of God’s desire, / And felt its honey of felicity / Flow through his veins like the rivers of Paradise, / Made body a nectar-cup of the Absolute.

02.09_065:026 - In sudden moments of revealing flame, / In passionate responses half-unveiled / He reached the rim of ecstasies unknown; / A touch supreme surprised his hurrying heart, / The clasp was remembered of the Wonderful, / And hints leaped down of white beatitudes.

02.09_065:027 - Eternity drew close disguised as Love / And laid its hand upon the body of Time.

02.09_065:028 - A little gift comes from the Immensitudes, / But measureless to life its gain of joy; / All the untold Beyond is mirrored there.

02.09_065:029 - A giant drop of the Bliss unknowable / Overwhelmed his limbs and round his soul became / A fiery ocean of felicity: / He foundered drowned in sweet and burning vasts: / The dire delight that could shatter mortal flesh, / The rapture that the gods sustain he bore.

02.09_065:030 - Immortal pleasure cleansed him in its waves / And turned his strength into undying power.

02.09_065:031 - Immortality captured Time and carried Life.


Canto 10 - 2.10: The Kingdoms and Godheads of the Little Mind

Section I - 66: realm of early light


02.10_066:001 - This too must now be overpassed and left, / As all must be until the Highest is gained / In whom the world and self grow true and one: / Till that is reached our journeying cannot cease.

02.10_066:002 - Always a nameless goal beckons beyond, / Always ascends the zigzag of the gods / And upward points the spirit’s climbing Fire.

02.10_066:003 - This breath of hundred-hued felicity / And its pure heightened figure of Time’s joy, / Tossed upon waves of flawless happiness, / Hammered into single beats of ecstasy, / This fraction of the spirit’s integer / Caught into a passionate greatness of extremes, / This limited being lifted to zenith bliss, / Happy to enjoy one touch of things supreme, / Packed into its sealed small infinity, / Its endless time-made world outfacing Time, / A little output of God’s vast delight.

02.10_066:004 - The moments stretched towards the eternal Now, / The hours discovered immortality, / But, satisfied with their sublime contents, / On peaks they ceased whose tops half-way to heaven / Pointed to an apex they could never mount, / To a grandeur in whose air they could not live.

02.10_066:005 - Inviting to their high and exquisite sphere, / To their secure and fine extremities / This creature who hugs his limits to feel safe, / These heights declined a greater adventure’s call.

02.10_066:006 - A glory and sweetness of satisfied desire / Tied up the spirit to golden posts of bliss.

02.10_066:007 - It could not house the wideness of a soul / Which needed all infinity for its home.

02.10_066:008 - A memory soft as grass and faint as sleep, / The beauty and call receding sank behind / Like a sweet song heard fading far away / Upon the long high road to Timelessness.

02.10_066:009 - Above was an ardent white tranquillity.

02.10_066:010 - A musing spirit looked out on the worlds / And like a brilliant clambering of skies / Passing through clarity to an unseen Light / Large lucent realms of Mind from stillness shone.

02.10_066:011 - But first he met a silver-grey expanse / Where Day and Night had wedded and were one: / It was a tract of dim and shifting rays / Parting Life’s sentient flow from Thought’s self-poise.

02.10_066:012 - A coalition of uncertainties / There exercised uneasy government / On a ground reserved for doubt and reasoned guess, / A rendezvous of Knowledge with Ignorance.

02.10_066:013 - At its low extremity held difficult sway / A mind that hardly saw and slowly found; / Its nature to our earthly nature close / And kin to our precarious mortal thought / That looks from soil to sky and sky to soil / But knows not the below nor the beyond, / It only sensed itself and outward things.

02.10_066:014 - This was the first means of our slow ascent / From the half-conscience of the animal soul / Living in a crowded press of shape-events / In a realm it cannot understand nor change: / Only it sees and acts in a given scene / And feels and joys and sorrows for a while.

02.10_066:015 - The ideas that drive the obscure embodied spirit / Along the roads of suffering and desire / In a world that struggles to discover Truth, / Found here their power to be and Nature-Force.

02.10_066:016 - Here are devised the forms of an ignorant life / That sees the empiric fact as settled law, / Labours for the hour and not for eternity / And trades its gains to meet the moment’s call: / The slow process of a material mind / Which serves the body it should rule and use / And needs to lean upon an erring sense, / Was born in that luminous obscurity.

02.10_066:017 - Advancing tardily from a limping start, / Crutching hypothesis upon argument, / Throning its theories as certitudes, / It reasons from the half-known to the unknown, / Ever constructing its frail house of thought, / Ever undoing the web that it has spun.

02.10_066:018 - A twilight sage whose shadow seems to him Self, / Moving from minute to brief minute lives; / A king dependent on his satellites / Signs the decrees of ignorant ministers, / A judge in half-possession of his proofs, / A voice clamant of uncertainty’s postulates, / An architect of knowledge, not its source.

02.10_066:019 - This powerful bondslave of his instruments / Thinks his low station Nature’s highest top, / Oblivious of his share in all things made / And haughtily humble in his own conceit / Believes himself a spawn of Matter’s mud / And takes his own creations for his cause.

02.10_066:020 - To eternal light and knowledge meant to rise, / Up from man’s bare beginning is our climb; / Out of earth’s heavy smallness we must break, / We must search our nature with spiritual fire: / An insect crawl preludes our glorious flight; / Our human state cradles the future god, / Our mortal frailty an immortal force.

02.10_066:021 -     At the glow-worm top of these pale glimmer-realms / Where dawn-sheen gambolled with the native dusk / And helped the Day to grow and Night to fail, / Escaping over a wide and shimmering bridge, / He came into a realm of early Light / And the regency of a half-risen sun.

02.10_066:022 - Out of its rays our mind’s full orb was born.

02.10_066:023 - Appointed by the Spirit of the Worlds / To mediate with the unknowing depths, / A prototypal deft Intelligence / Half-poised on equal wings of thought and doubt / Toiled ceaselessly twixt being’s hidden ends.

02.10_066:024 - A Secrecy breathed in life’s moving act; / A covert nurse of Nature’s miracles, / It shaped life’s wonders out of Matter’s mud: / It cut the pattern of the shapes of things, / It pitched mind’s tent in the vague ignorant Vast.

02.10_066:025 - A master Magician of measure and device / Has made an eternity from recurring forms / And to the wandering spectator thought / Assigned a seat on the inconscient stage.

02.10_066:026 - On earth by the will of this Arch-Intelligence / A bodiless energy put on Matter’s robe; / Proton and photon served the imager Eye / To change things subtle into a physical world / And the invisible appeared as shape / And the impalpable was felt as mass: / Magic of percept joined with concept’s art / And lent to each object an interpreting name: / Idea was disguised in a body’s artistry, / And by a strange atomic law’s mystique / A frame was made in which the sense would put / Its symbol picture of the universe.

02.10_066:027 - Even a greater miracle was done.

02.10_066:028 - The mediating light linked body’s power, / The sleep and dreaming of the tree and plant, / The animal’s vibrant sense, the thought in man, / To the effulgence of a Ray above.

02.10_066:029 - Its skill endorsing Matter’s right to think / Cut sentient passages for the mind of flesh / And found a means for Nescience to know.

02.10_066:030 - Offering its little squares and cubes of word / As figured substitutes for reality, / A mummified mnemonic alphabet, / It helped the unseeing force to read her works.

02.10_066:031 - A buried consciousness arose in her / And now she dreams herself human and awake.

02.10_066:032 - But all was still a mobile Ignorance; / Still Knowledge could not come and firmly grasp / This huge invention seen as a universe.

02.10_066:033 - A specialist of logic’s hard machine / Imposed its rigid artifice on the soul; / An aide of the inventor intellect, / It cut Truth into manageable bits / That each might have his ration of thought-food, / Then new-built Truth’s slain body by its art: / A robot exact and serviceable and false / Displaced the spirit’s finer view of things: / A polished engine did the work of a god.

02.10_066:034 - None the true body found, its soul seemed dead: / None had the inner look which sees Truth’s whole; / All glorified the glittering substitute.

02.10_066:035 - Then from the secret heights a wave swept down, / A brilliant chaos of rebel light arose; / It looked above and saw the dazzling peaks, / It looked within and woke the sleeping god.

02.10_066:036 - Imagination called her shining squads / That venture into undiscovered scenes / Where all the marvels lurk none yet has known: / Lifting her beautiful and miraculous head, / She conspired with inspiration’s sister brood / To fill thought’s skies with glimmering nebulae.

02.10_066:037 - A bright Error fringed the mystery-altar’s frieze; / Darkness grew nurse to wisdom’s occult sun, / Myth suckled knowledge with her lustrous milk; / The infant passed from dim to radiant breasts.

02.10_066:038 - Thus worked the Power upon the growing world; / Its subtle craft withheld the full-orbed blaze, / Cherished the soul’s childhood and on fictions fed / Far richer in their sweet and nectarous sap / Nourishing its immature divinity / Than the staple or dry straw of Reason’s tilth, / Its heaped fodder of innumerable facts, / Plebian fare on which today we thrive.

02.10_066:039 - Thus streamed down from the realm of early Light, / Ethereal thinkings into Matter’s world; / Its gold-horned herds trooped into earth’s cave-heart.

02.10_066:040 - Its morning rays illume our twilight’s eyes, / Its young formations move the mind of earth / To labour and to dream and new-create, / To feel beauty’s touch and know the world and self: / The Golden Child began to think and see.



Section I - 67: half-risen sun


02.10_067:001 - In those bright realms are Mind’s first forward steps.

02.10_067:002 - Ignorant of all but eager to know all, / Its curious slow enquiry there begins; / Ever searching it grasps at shapes around, / Ever it hopes to find out greater things.

02.10_067:003 - Ardent and golden gleamed with sunrise fires, / Alert it lives upon invention’s verge.

02.10_067:004 - Yet all it does is on an infant’s scale, / As if the cosmos were a nursery game, / Mind, life the playthings of a Titan’s babe.

02.10_067:005 - As one it works who builds a mimic fort / Miraculously stable for a while, / Made of the sands upon a bank of Time / Mid an occult eternity’s shoreless sea.

02.10_067:006 - A small keen instrument the great Puissance chose, / An arduous pastime passionately pursues; / To teach the Ignorance is her difficult charge, / Her thought starts from an original nescient Void / And what she teaches she herself must learn / Arousing knowledge from its sleepy lair.

02.10_067:007 - For knowledge comes not to us as a guest / Called into our chamber from the outer world; / A friend and inmate of our secret self, / It hid behind our minds and fell asleep / And slowly wakes beneath the glows of life; / The mighty daemon lies unshaped within, / To evoke, to give it form is Nature’s task.

02.10_067:008 - All was a chaos of the true and false, / Mind sought amid deep mists of Nescience; / It looked within itself but saw not God.

02.10_067:009 - A material interim diplomacy / Denied the truth that transient truths might live / And hid the deity in creed and guess / That the World-Ignorance might grow slowly wise.

02.10_067:010 - This was the imbroglio made by sovereign Mind / Looking from a gleam-ridge into the Night / In its first tamperings with Inconscience: / Its alien dusk baffles her luminous eyes; / Her rapid hands must learn a cautious zeal; / Only a slow advance the earth can bear.

02.10_067:011 - Yet was her strength unlike the unseeing earth’s / Compelled to handle makeshift instruments / Invented by the life-force and the flesh.

02.10_067:012 - Earth all perceives through doubtful images, / All she conceives in hazardous jets of sight, / Small lights kindled by touches of groping thought.

02.10_067:013 - Incapable of the soul’s direct inlook / She sees by spasms and solders knowledge-scrap, / Makes Truth the slave-girl of her indigence, / Expelling Nature’s mystic unity / Cuts into quantum and mass the moving All; / She takes for measuring-rod her ignorance.

02.10_067:014 - In her own domain a pontiff and a seer, / That greater Power with her half-risen sun / Wrought within limits but possessed her field; / She knew by a privilege of thinking force / And claimed an infant sovereignty of sight.

02.10_067:015 - In her eyes however darkly fringed was lit / The Archangel’s gaze who knows inspired his acts / And shapes a world in its far-seeing flame.

02.10_067:016 - In her own realm she stumbles not nor fails, / But moves in boundaries of subtle power / Across which mind can step towards the sun.

02.10_067:017 - A candidate for a higher suzerainty, / A passage she cut through from Night to Light, / And searched for an ungrasped Omniscience.



Canto Section68 - 68: dwarfish trinity

Section 68.1 - 68.1: pigmy Thought (physical mind)

02.10_068:001 - A dwarf three-bodied trinity was her serf.

02.10_068:002 - First, smallest of the three, but strong of limb, / A low-brow with a square and heavy jowl, / A pigmy Thought needing to live in bounds / For ever stooped to hammer fact and form.

02.10_068:003 - Absorbed and cabined in external sight, / It takes its stand on Nature’s solid base.

02.10_068:004 - A technician admirable, a thinker crude, / A riveter of Life to habit’s grooves, / Obedient to gross Matter’s tyranny, / A prisoner of the moulds in which it works, / It binds itself by what itself creates.

02.10_068:005 - A slave of a fixed mass of absolute rules, / It sees as Law the habits of the world, / It sees as Truth the habits of the mind.

02.10_068:006 - In its realm of concrete images and events / Turning in a worn circle of ideas / And ever repeating old familiar acts, / It lives content with the common and the known.

02.10_068:007 - It loves the old ground that was its dwelling-place: / Abhorring change as an audacious sin, / Distrustful of each new discovery / Only it advances step by careful step / And fears as if a deadly abyss the unknown.

02.10_068:008 - A prudent treasurer of its ignorance, / It shrinks from adventure, blinks at glorious hope, / Preferring a safe foothold upon things / To the dangerous joy of wideness and of height.

02.10_068:009 - The world’s slow impressions on its labouring mind, / Tardy imprints almost indelible, / Increase their value by their poverty; / The old sure memories are its capital stock: / Only what sense can grasp seems absolute: / External fact it figures as sole truth, / Wisdom identifies with the earthward look, / And things long known and actions always done / Are to its clinging hold a balustrade / Of safety on the perilous stair of Time.

02.10_068:010 - Heaven’s trust to it are the established ancient ways, / Immutable laws man has no right to change, / A sacred legacy from the great dead past / Or the one road that God has made for life, / A firm shape of Nature never to be changed, / Part of the huge routine of the universe.

02.10_068:011 - A smile from the Preserver of the Worlds / Sent down of old this guardian Mind to earth / That all might stand in their fixed changeless type / And from their secular posture never move.

02.10_068:012 - One sees it circling faithful to its task, / Tireless in an assigned tradition’s round; / In decayed and crumbling offices of Time / It keeps close guard in front of custom’s wall, / Or in an ancient Night’s dim environs / It dozes on a little courtyard’s stones / And barks at every unfamiliar light / As at a foe who would break up its home, / A watch-dog of the spirit’s sense-railed house / Against intruders from the Invisible, / Nourished on scraps of life and Matter’s bones / In its kennel of objective certitude.

02.10_068:013 - And yet behind it stands a cosmic might: / A measured Greatness keeps its vaster plan, / A fathomless sameness rhythms the tread of life; / The stars’ changeless orbits furrow inert Space, / A million species follow one mute Law.

02.10_068:014 - A huge inertness is the world’s defence, / Even in change is treasured changelessness; / Into inertia revolution sinks, / In a new dress the old resumes its role; / The Energy acts, the stable is its seal: / On Shiva’s breast is stayed the enormous dance.


Section 68.2 - 68.2: fiery spirit (vital mind)

02.10_068:015 -     A fiery spirit came, next of the three.

02.10_068:016 - A hunchback rider of the red Wild-Ass, / A rash Intelligence leaped down lion-maned / From the great mystic Flame that rings the worlds / And with its dire edge eats at being’s heart.

02.10_068:017 - Thence sprang the burning vision of Desire.

02.10_068:018 - A thousand shapes it wore, took numberless names: / A need of multitude and uncertainty / Pricks it for ever to pursue the One / On countless roads across the vasts of Time / Through circuits of unending difference.

02.10_068:019 - It burns all breasts with an ambiguous fire.

02.10_068:020 - A radiance gleaming on a murky stream, / It flamed towards heaven, then sank, engulfed towards hell; / It climbed to drag down Truth into the mire / And used for muddy ends its brilliant Force.

02.10_068:021 - A huge chameleon gold and blue and red / Turning to black and grey and lurid brown, / Hungry it stared from a mottled bough of life / To snap up insect joys, its favourite food, / The dingy sustenance of a sumptuous frame / Nursing the splendid passion of its hues.

02.10_068:022 - A snake of flame with a dark cloud for tail, / Followed by a dream-brood of glittering thoughts, / A lifted head with many-tinged flickering crests, / It licked at knowledge with a smoky tongue.

02.10_068:023 - A whirlpool sucking in an empty air, / It based on vacancy stupendous claims, / In Nothingness born to Nothingness returned, / Yet all the time unwittingly it drove / Towards the hidden Something that is All.

02.10_068:024 - Ardent to find, incapable to retain, / A brilliant instability was its mark, / To err its inborn trend, its native cue.

02.10_068:025 - At once to an unreflecting credence prone, / It thought all true that flattered its own hopes; / It cherished golden nothings born of wish, / It snatched at the unreal for provender.

02.10_068:026 - In darkness it discovered luminous shapes; / Peering into a shadow-hung half-light / It saw hued images scrawled on Fancy’s cave; / Or it swept in circles through conjecture’s night / And caught in imagination’s camera / Bright scenes of promise held by transient flares, / Fixed in life’s air the feet of hurrying dreams, / Kept prints of passing Forms and hooded Powers / And flash-images of half-seen verities.

02.10_068:027 - An eager spring to seize and to possess / Unguided by reason or the seeing soul / Was its first natural motion and its last, / It squandered life’s force to achieve the impossible: / It scorned the straight road and ran on wandering curves / And left what it had won for untried things; / It saw unrealised aims as instant fate / And chose the precipice for its leap to heaven.

02.10_068:028 - Adventure its system in the gamble of life, / It took fortuitous gains as safe results; / Error discouraged not its confident view / Ignorant of the deep law of being’s ways / And failure could not slow its fiery clutch; / One chance made true warranted all the rest.

02.10_068:029 - Attempt, not victory, was the charm of life.

02.10_068:030 - An uncertain winner of uncertain stakes, / Instinct its dam and the life-mind its sire, / It ran its race and came in first or last.

02.10_068:031 - Yet were its works nor small and vain nor null; / It nursed a portion of infinity’s strength / And could create the high things its fancy willed; / Its passion caught what calm intelligence missed.

02.10_068:032 - Insight of impulse laid its leaping grasp / On heavens high Thought had hidden in dazzling mist, / Caught glimmers that revealed a lurking sun: / It probed the void and found a treasure there.

02.10_068:033 - A half-intuition purpled in its sense; / It threw the lightning’s fork and hit the unseen.

02.10_068:034 - It saw in the dark and vaguely blinked in the light, / Ignorance was its field, the unknown its prize.



Section 68.3 - 68.3: Reason, the squat godhead artisan

02.10_068:035 - Of all these Powers the greatest was the last.

02.10_068:036 - Arriving late from a far plane of thought / Into a packed irrational world of Chance / Where all was grossly felt and blindly done, / Yet the haphazard seemed the inevitable, / Came Reason, the squat godhead artisan, / To her narrow house upon a ridge in Time.

02.10_068:037 - Adept of clear contrivance and design, / A pensive face and close and peering eyes, / She took her firm and irremovable seat, / The strongest, wisest of the troll-like Three.

02.10_068:038 - Armed with her lens and measuring-rod and probe, / She looked upon an object universe / And the multitudes that in it live and die / And the body of Space and the fleeing soul of Time, / And took the earth and stars into her hands / To try what she could make of these strange things.

02.10_068:039 - In her strong purposeful laborious mind, / Inventing her scheme-lines of reality / And the geometric curves of her time-plan, / She multiplied her slow half-cuts at Truth: / Impatient of enigma and the unknown, / Intolerant of the lawless and unique, / Imposing reflection on the march of Force, / Imposing clarity on the unfathomable, / She strove to reduce to rules the mystic world.

02.10_068:040 - Nothing she knew but all things hoped to know.

02.10_068:041 - In dark inconscient realms once void of thought, / Missioned by a supreme Intelligence / To throw its ray upon the obscure Vast, / An imperfect light leading an erring mass / By the power of sense and the idea and word, / She ferrets out Nature’s process, substance, cause.

02.10_068:042 - All life to harmonise by thought’s control / She with the huge imbroglio struggles still; / Ignorant of all but her own seeking mind / To save the world from Ignorance she came.

02.10_068:043 - A sovereign worker through the centuries, / Observing and re-moulding all that is, / Confident she took up her stupendous charge.

02.10_068:044 - There the low bent and mighty figure sits / Bowed under the arc-lamps of her factory-home / Amid the clatter and ringing of her tools.

02.10_068:045 - A rigorous stare in her creative eyes / Coercing the plastic stuff of cosmic Mind, / She sets the hard inventions of her brain / In a pattern of eternal fixity: / Indifferent to the cosmic dumb demand, / Unconscious of too close realities, / Of the unspoken thought, the voiceless heart, / She leans to forge her credos and iron codes / And metal structures to imprison life / And mechanic models of all things that are.

02.10_068:046 - For the world seen she weaves a world conceived: / She spins in stiff but unsubstantial lines / Her gossamer word-webs of abstract thought, / Her segment systems of the Infinite, / Her theodicies and cosmogonic charts / And myths by which she explains the inexplicable.

02.10_068:047 - At will she spaces in thin air of mind / Like maps in the school-house of intellect hung, / Forcing wide Truth into a narrow scheme, / Her numberless warring strict philosophies; / Out of Nature’s body of phenomenon / She carves with Thought’s keen edge in rigid lines / Like rails for the World-Magician’s power to run, / Her sciences precise and absolute.

02.10_068:048 - On the huge bare walls of human nescience / Written round Nature’s deep dumb hieroglyphs / She pens in clear demotic characters / The vast encyclopaedia of her thoughts; / An algebra of her mathematics’ signs, / Her numbers and unerring formulas / She builds to clinch her summary of things.

02.10_068:049 - On all sides runs as if in a cosmic mosque / Tracing the scriptural verses of her laws / The daedal of her patterned arabesques, / Art of her wisdom, artifice of her lore.

02.10_068:050 - This art, this artifice are her only stock.

02.10_068:051 - In her high works of pure intelligence, / In her withdrawal from the senses’ trap, / There comes no breaking of the walls of mind, / There leaps no rending flash of absolute power, / There dawns no light of heavenly certitude.

02.10_068:052 - A million faces wears her knowledge here / And every face is turbaned with a doubt.

02.10_068:053 - All now is questioned, all reduced to nought.

02.10_068:054 - Once monumental in their massive craft / Her old great mythic writings disappear / And into their place start strict ephemeral signs; / This constant change spells progress to her eyes: / Her thought is an endless march without a goal.

02.10_068:055 - There is no summit on which she can stand / And see in a single glance the Infinite’s whole.


Section 68.4 - 68.4: An inconclusive play is Reason

02.10_068:056 -     An inconclusive play is Reason’s toil.

02.10_068:057 - Each strong idea can use her as its tool; / Accepting every brief she pleads her case.

02.10_068:058 - Open to every thought, she cannot know.

02.10_068:059 - The eternal Advocate seated as judge / Armours in logic’s invulnerable mail / A thousand combatants for Truth’s veiled throne / And sets on a high horseback of argument / To tilt for ever with a wordy lance / In a mock tournament where none can win.

02.10_068:060 - Assaying thought’s values with her rigid tests / Balanced she sits on wide and empty air, / Aloof and pure in her impartial poise.

02.10_068:061 - Absolute her judgments seem but none is sure; / Time cancels all her verdicts in appeal.

02.10_068:062 - Although like sunbeams to our glow-worm mind / Her knowledge feigns to fall from a clear heaven, / Its rays are a lantern’s lustres in the Night; / She throws a glittering robe on Ignorance.

02.10_068:063 - But now is lost her ancient sovereign claim / To rule mind’s high realm in her absolute right, / Bind thought with logic’s forged infallible chain / Or see truth nude in a bright abstract haze.

02.10_068:064 - A master and slave of stark phenomenon, / She travels on the roads of erring sight / Or looks upon a set mechanical world / Constructed for her by her instruments.

02.10_068:065 - A bullock yoked in the cart of proven fact, / She drags huge knowledge-bales through Matter’s dust / To reach utility’s immense bazaar.

02.10_068:066 - Apprentice she has grown to her old drudge; / An aided sense is her seeking’s arbiter.

02.10_068:067 - This now she uses as the assayer’s stone.

02.10_068:068 - As if she knew not facts are husks of truth, / The husks she keeps, the kernel throws aside.

02.10_068:069 - An ancient wisdom fades into the past, / The ages’ faith becomes an idle tale, / God passes out of the awakened thought, / An old discarded dream needed no more: / Only she seeks mechanic nature’s keys.

02.10_068:070 - Interpreting stone-laws inevitable / She digs into Matter’s hard concealing soil, / To unearth the processes of all things done.

02.10_068:071 - A loaded huge self-worked machine appears / To her eye’s eager and admiring stare, / An intricate and meaningless enginery / Of ordered fateful and unfailing chance: / Ingenious and meticulous and minute, / Its brute unconscious accurate device / Unrolls an unerring march, maps a sure road; / It plans without thinking, acts without a will, / A million purposes serves with purpose none / And builds a rational world without a mind.

02.10_068:072 - It has no mover, no maker, no idea: / Its vast self-action toils without a cause; / A lifeless Energy irresistibly driven, / Death’s head on the body of Necessity, / Engenders life and fathers consciousness, / Then wonders why all was and whence it came.

02.10_068:073 - Our thoughts are parts of the immense machine, / Our ponderings but a freak of Matter’s law, / The mystic’s lore was a fancy or a blind; / Of soul or spirit we have now no need: / Matter is the admirable Reality, / The patent unescapable miracle, / The hard truth of things, simple, eternal, sole.

02.10_068:074 - A suicidal rash expenditure / Creating the world by a mystery of self-loss / Has poured its scattered works on empty space; / Late shall the self-disintegrating Force / Contract the immense expansion it has made: / Then ends this mighty and unmeaning toil, / The Void is left bare, vacant as before.

02.10_068:075 - Thus vindicated, crowned, the grand new Thought / Explained the world and mastered all its laws, / Touched the dumb roots, woke veiled tremendous powers; / It bound to service the unconscious djinns / That sleep unused in Matter’s ignorant trance.

02.10_068:076 - All was precise, rigid, indubitable.

02.10_068:077 - But when on Matter’s rock of ages based / A whole stood up firm and clear-cut and safe, / All staggered back into a sea of doubt; / This solid scheme melted in endless flux: / She had met the formless Power inventor of forms; / Suddenly she stumbled upon things unseen: / A lightning from the undiscovered Truth / Startled her eyes with its perplexing glare / And dug a gulf between the Real and Known / Till all her knowledge seemed an ignorance.

02.10_068:078 - Once more the world was made a wonder-web, / A magic’s process in a magical space, / An unintelligible miracle’s depths / Whose source is lost in the Ineffable.

02.10_068:079 - Once more we face the blank Unknowable.

02.10_068:080 - In a crash of values, in a huge doom-crack, / In the sputter and scatter of her breaking work / She lost her clear conserved constructed world.

02.10_068:081 - A quantum dance remained, a sprawl of chance / In Energy’s stupendous tripping whirl: / A ceaseless motion in the unbounded Void / Invented forms without a thought or aim: / Necessity and Cause were shapeless ghosts; / Matter was an incident in being’s flow, / Law but a clock-work habit of blind force.

02.10_068:082 - Ideals, ethics, systems had no base / And soon collapsed or without sanction lived; / All grew a chaos, a heave and clash and strife.

02.10_068:083 - Ideas warring and fierce leaped upon life; / A hard compression held down anarchy / And liberty was only a phantom’s name: / Creation and destruction waltzed inarmed / On the bosom of a torn and quaking earth; / All reeled into a world of Kali’s dance.

02.10_068:084 - Thus tumbled, sinking, sprawling in the Void, / Clutching for props, a soil on which to stand, / She only saw a thin atomic Vast, / The rare-point sparse substratum Universe / On which floats a solid world’s phenomenal face.

02.10_068:085 - Alone a process of events was there / And Nature’s plastic and protean change / And, strong by death to slay, or to create / The riven invisible atom’s omnipotent force.

02.10_068:086 - One chance remained that here might be a power / To liberate man from the old inadequate means / And leave him sovereign of the earthly scene.

02.10_068:087 - For Reason then might grasp the original Force / To drive her car upon the roads of Time.

02.10_068:088 - All then might serve the need of the thinking race, / An absolute State found order’s absolute, / To a standardised perfection cut all things, / In society build a just exact machine.

02.10_068:089 - Then science and reason careless of the soul / Could iron out a tranquil uniform world, / Aeonic seekings glut with outward truths / And a single patterned thinking force on mind, / Inflicting Matter’s logic on Spirit’s dreams / A reasonable animal make of man / And a symmetrical fabric of his life.

02.10_068:090 - This would be Nature’s peak on an obscure globe, / The grand result of the long ages’ toil, / Earth’s evolution crowned, her mission done.

02.10_068:091 - So might it be if the spirit fell asleep; / Man then might rest content and live in peace, / Master of Nature who wants her bondslave worked, / The world’s disorder hardening into Law,— / If Life’s dire heart arose not in revolt, / If God within could find no greater plan.

02.10_068:092 - But many-visaged is the cosmic Soul; / A touch can alter the fixed front of Fate.

02.10_068:093 - A sudden turn can come, a road appear, / A greater Mind may see a greater Truth, / Or we may find when all the rest has failed / Hid in ourselves the key of perfect change.

02.10_068:094 - Ascending from the soil where creep our days, / Earth’s consciousness may marry with the Sun, / Our mortal life ride on the spirit’s wing, / Our finite thoughts commune with the Infinite.


Section 68.5 - 68.5: bright kingdoms of the rising sun

02.10_068:095 -     In the bright kingdoms of the rising Sun / All is a birth into a power of light: / All here deformed guards there its happy shape, / Here all is mixed and marred, there pure and whole; / Yet each is a passing step, a moment’s phase.

02.10_068:096 - Awake to a greater Truth beyond her acts, / The mediatrix sat and saw her works / And felt the marvel in them and the force / But knew the power behind the face of Time: / She did the task, obeyed the knowledge given, / Her deep heart yearned towards great ideal things / And from the light looked out to wider light: / A brilliant hedge drawn round her narrowed her power; / Faithful to her limited sphere she toiled, but knew / Its highest, widest seeing was a half-search, / Its mightiest acts a passage or a stage.

02.10_068:097 - For not by Reason was creation made / And not by Reason can the Truth be seen / Which through the veils of thought, the screens of sense / Hardly the spirit’s vision can descry / Dimmed by the imperfection of its means: / The little Mind is tied to little things: / Its sense is but the spirit’s outward touch / Half-waked in a world of dark Inconscience; / It feels out for its beings and its forms / Like one left fumbling in the ignorant Night.

02.10_068:098 - In this small mould of infant mind and sense / Desire is a child-heart’s cry crying for bliss, / Our reason only a toys’ artificer, / A rule-maker in a strange stumbling game.

02.10_068:099 - But she her dwarf aids knew whose confident sight / A bounded prospect took for the far goal.

02.10_068:100 - The world she has made is an interim report / Of a traveller towards the half-found truth in things / Moving twixt nescience and nescience.

02.10_068:101 - For nothing is known while aught remains concealed; / The Truth is known only when all is seen. #conditions-of-knowledge #conditions-of-truth #purpose-of-obscurity #the-truth #truth-as-all-knowingness #utility-of-ignorance

02.10_068:102 - Attracted by the All that is the One, / She yearns towards a higher light than hers; / Hid by her cults and creeds she has glimpsed God’s face: / She knows she has but found a form, a robe, / But ever she hopes to see him in her heart / And feel the body of his reality.

02.10_068:103 - As yet a mask is there and not a brow, / Although sometimes two hidden eyes appear: / Reason cannot tear off that glimmering mask, / Her efforts only make it glimmer more; / In packets she ties up the Indivisible; / Finding her hands too small to hold vast Truth / She breaks up knowledge into alien parts / Or peers through cloud-rack for a vanished sun: / She sees, not understanding what she has seen, / Through the locked visages of finite things / The myriad aspects of infinity.

02.10_068:104 - One day the Face must burn out through the mask.

02.10_068:105 - Our ignorance is Wisdom’s chrysalis, / Our error weds new knowledge on its way, / Its darkness is a blackened knot of light; / Thought dances hand in hand with Nescience / On the grey road that winds towards the Sun.

02.10_068:106 - Even while her fingers fumble at the knots / Which bind them to their strange companionship, / Into the moments of their married strife / Sometimes break flashes of the enlightening Fire.

02.10_068:107 - Even now great thoughts are here that walk alone: / Armed they have come with the infallible word / In an investiture of intuitive light / That is a sanction from the eyes of God; / Announcers of a distant Truth they flame / Arriving from the rim of eternity.

02.10_068:108 - A fire shall come out of the infinitudes, / A greater Gnosis shall regard the world / Crossing out of some far omniscience / On lustrous seas from the still rapt Alone / To illumine the deep heart of self and things.

02.10_068:109 - A timeless knowledge it shall bring to Mind, / Its aim to life, to Ignorance its close.



Section I - 69: pure thought mind


02.10_069:001 - Above in a high breathless stratosphere, / Overshadowing the dwarfish trinity, / Lived, aspirants to a limitless Beyond, / Captives of Space, walled by the limiting heavens, / In the unceasing circuit of the hours, / Yearning for the straight paths of eternity, / And from their high station looked down on this world / Two sun-gaze Daemons witnessing all that is.

02.10_069:002 - A power to uplift the laggard world, / Imperious rode a huge high-winged Life-Thought / Unwont to tread the firm unchanging soil: / Accustomed to a blue infinity, / It planed in sunlit sky and starlit air; / It saw afar the unreached Immortal’s home / And heard afar the voices of the gods.

02.10_069:003 - Iconoclast and shatterer of Time’s forts, / Overleaping limit and exceeding norm, / It lit the thoughts that glow through the centuries / And moved to acts of superhuman force.

02.10_069:004 - As far as its self-winged airplanes could fly, / Visiting the future in great brilliant raids / It reconnoitred vistas of dream-fate.

02.10_069:005 - Apt to conceive, unable to attain, / It drew its concept-maps and vision-plans / Too large for the architecture of mortal Space.

02.10_069:006 - Beyond in wideness where no footing is, / An imagist of bodiless Ideas, / Impassive to the cry of life and sense, / A pure Thought-Mind surveyed the cosmic act.

02.10_069:007 - Archangel of a white transcending realm, / It saw the world from solitary heights / Luminous in a remote and empty air.


Canto 11 - 2.11: The Kingdoms and Godheads of the Greater Mind

Section I - 70: splendours of ideal mind


02.11_070:001 - There ceased the limits of the labouring Power.

02.11_070:002 - But being and creation cease not there.

02.11_070:003 - For Thought transcends the circles of mortal mind, / It is greater than its earthly instrument: / The godhead crammed into mind’s narrow space / Escapes on every side into some vast / That is a passage to infinity.

02.11_070:004 - It moves eternal in the spirit’s field, / A runner towards the far spiritual light, / A child and servant of the spirit’s force.

02.11_070:005 - But mind too falls back from a nameless peak.

02.11_070:006 - His being stretched beyond the sight of Thought.

02.11_070:007 - For the spirit is eternal and unmade / And not by thinking was its greatness born, / And not by thinking can its knowledge come.

02.11_070:008 - It knows itself and in itself it lives, / It moves where no thought is nor any form.

02.11_070:009B - Its feet are steadied upon finite things, / Its wings can dare to cross the Infinite.

02.11_070:010 - Arriving into his ken a wonder space / Of great and marvellous meetings called his steps, / Where Thought leaned on a Vision beyond thought / And shaped a world from the Unthinkable.

02.11_070:011 - On peaks imagination cannot tread, / In the horizons of a tireless sight, / Under a blue veil of eternity / The splendours of ideal Mind were seen / Outstretched across the boundaries of things known.

02.11_070:012 - Origin of the little that we are, / Instinct with the endless more that we must be, / A prop of all that human strength enacts, / Creator of hopes by earth unrealised, / It spreads beyond the expanding universe; / It wings beyond the boundaries of Dream, / It overtops the ceiling of life’s soar.

02.11_070:013 - Awake in a luminous sphere unbound by Thought, / Exposed to omniscient immensities, / It casts on our world its great crowned influences, / Its speed that outstrips the ambling of the hours, / Its force that strides invincibly through Time, / Its mights that bridge the gulf twixt man and God, / Its lights that combat Ignorance and Death.

02.11_070:014 - In its vast ambit of ideal Space / Where beauty and mightiness walk hand in hand, / The Spirit’s truths take form as living Gods / And each can build a world in its own right.

02.11_070:015 - In an air which doubt and error cannot mark / With the stigmata of their deformity, / In communion with the musing privacy / Of a truth that sees in an unerring light / Where the sight falters not nor wanders thought, / Exempt from our world’s exorbitant tax of tears, / Dreaming its luminous creations gaze / On the Ideas that people eternity.

02.11_070:016 - In a sun-blaze of joy and absolute power / Above the Masters of the Ideal throne / In sessions of secure felicity, / In regions of illumined certitude.

02.11_070:017 - Far are those realms from our labour and yearning and call, / Perfection’s reign and hallowed sanctuary / Closed to the uncertain thoughts of human mind, / Remote from the turbid tread of mortal life.

02.11_070:018 - But since our secret selves are next of kin, / A breath of unattained divinity / Visits the imperfect earth on which we toil; / Across a gleaming ether’s golden laugh / A light falls on our vexed unsatisfied lives, / A thought comes down from the ideal worlds / And moves us to new-model even here / Some image of their greatness and appeal / And wonder beyond the ken of mortal hope.

02.11_070:019 - Amid the heavy sameness of the days / And contradicted by the human law, / A faith in things that are not and must be / Lives comrade of this world’s delight and pain, / The child of the secret soul’s forbidden desire / Born of its amour with eternity.

02.11_070:020 - Our spirits break free from their environment; / The future brings its face of miracle near, / Its godhead looks at us with present eyes; / Acts deemed impossible grow natural; / We feel the hero’s immortality, / The courage and the strength death cannot touch / Awake in limbs that are mortal, hearts that fail; / We move by the rapid impulse of a will / That scorns the tardy trudge of mortal Time.

02.11_070:021 - These promptings come not from an alien sphere: / Ourselves are citizens of that mother State, / Adventurers, we have colonised Matter’s night.

02.11_070:022 - But now our rights are barred, our passports void; / We live self-exiled from our heavenlier home.

02.11_070:023 - An errant ray from the immortal Mind / Accepted the earth’s blindness and became / Our human thought, servant of Ignorance.

02.11_070:024 - An exile, labourer on this unsure globe / Captured and driven in Life’s nescient grasp, / Hampered by obscure cell and treacherous nerve, / It dreams of happier states and nobler powers, / The natural privilege of unfallen gods / Recalling still its old lost sovereignty.

02.11_070:025 - Amidst earth’s mist and fog and mud and stone / It still remembers its exalted sphere / And the high city of its splendid birth.

02.11_070:026 - A memory steals from a lost heaven of Truth, / A wide release comes near, a Glory calls, / A might looks out, an estranged felicity.

02.11_070:027 - In glamorous passages of half-veiled light / Wandering, a brilliant shadow of itself, / This quick uncertain leader of blind gods, / This tender of small lamps, this minister serf / Hired by a mind and body for earth-use / Forgets its work mid crude realities; / It recovers its renounced imperial right, / It wears once more its purple robe of thought / And knows itself the Ideal’s seer and king, / Communicant and prophet of the Unborn, / Heir to delight and immortality.

02.11_070:028 - All things are real that here are only dreams, / In our unknown depths sleeps their reserve of truth, / On our unreached heights they reign and come to us / In thought and muse trailing their robes of light.

02.11_070:029 - But our dwarf will and cold pragmatic sense / Admit not the celestial visitants: / Awaiting us on the Ideal’s peaks / Or guarded in our secret self unseen / Yet flashed sometimes across the awakened soul, / Hide from our lives their greatness, beauty, power.

02.11_070:030 - Our present feels sometimes their regal touch, / Our future strives towards their luminous thrones: / Out of spiritual secrecy they gaze, / Immortal footfalls in mind’s corridors sound: / Our souls can climb into the shining planes, / The breadths from which they came can be our home.

02.11_070:031 - His privilege regained of shadowless sight / The Thinker entered the immortals’ air / And drank again his pure and mighty source.

02.11_070:032 - Immutable in rhythmic calm and joy / He saw, sovereignly free in limitless light, / The unfallen planes, the thought-created worlds / Where Knowledge is the leader of the act / And Matter is of thinking substance made, / Feeling, a heaven-bird poised on dreaming wings, / Answers Truth’s call as to a parent’s voice, / Form luminous leaps from the all-shaping beam / And Will is a conscious chariot of the Gods, / And Life, a splendour-stream of musing Force, / Carries the voices of the mystic Suns.

02.11_070:033 - A happiness it brings of whispered truth; / There runs in its flow honeying the bosom of Space / A laughter from the immortal heart of Bliss, / And the unfathomed Joy of timelessness, / The sound of Wisdom’s murmur in the Unknown / And the breath of an unseen Infinity.

02.11_070:034 - In gleaming clarities of amethyst air / The chainless and omnipotent Spirit of Mind / Brooded on the blue lotus of the Idea.

02.11_070:035 - A gold supernal sun of timeless Truth / Poured down the mystery of the eternal Ray / Through a silence quivering with the word of Light / On an endless ocean of discovery.

02.11_070:036 - Far-off he saw the joining hemispheres.

02.11_070:037 - On meditation’s mounting edge of trance / Great stairs of thought climbed up to unborn heights / Where Time’s last ridges touch eternity’s skies / And Nature speaks to the spirit’s absolute.


Section I - 71: triple realm of ordered thought


02.11_071:001 - A triple realm of ordered thought came first, / A small beginning of immense ascent: / Above were bright ethereal skies of mind, / A packed and endless soar as if sky pressed sky / Buttressed against the Void on bastioned light; / The highest strove to neighbour eternity, / The largest widened into the infinite.

02.11_071:002 - But though immortal, mighty and divine, / The first realms were close and kin to human mind; / Their deities shape our greater thinking’s roads, / A fragment of their puissance can be ours: / These breadths were not too broad for our souls to range, / These heights were not too high for human hope.

02.11_071:003 - A triple flight led to this triple world.

02.11_071:004 - Although abrupt for common strengths to tread, / Its upward slope looks down on our earth-poise: / On a slant not too precipitously steep / One could turn back travelling deep descending lines / To commune with the mortal’s universe.

02.11_071:005B - The mighty wardens of the ascending stair / Who intercede with the all-creating Word, / There waited for the pilgrim heaven-bound soul; / Holding the thousand keys of the Beyond / They proffered their knowledge to the climbing mind / And filled the life with Thought’s immensities.

02.11_071:006 - The prophet hierophants of the occult Law, / The flame-bright hierarchs of the divine Truth, / Interpreters between man’s mind and God’s, / They bring the immortal fire to mortal men.

02.11_071:007 - Iridescent, bodying the invisible, / The guardians of the Eternal’s bright degrees / Fronted the sun in radiant phalanxes.

02.11_071:008 - Afar they seemed a symbol imagery, / Illumined originals of the shadowy script / In which our sight transcribes the ideal Ray, / Or icons figuring a mystic Truth, / But, nearer, Gods and living Presences.

02.11_071:009 - A march of friezes marked the lowest steps; / Fantastically ornate and richly small, / They had room for the whole meaning of a world, / Symbols minute of its perfection’s joy, / Strange beasts that were Nature’s forces made alive / And, wakened to the wonder of his role, / Man grown an image undefaced of God / And objects the fine coin of Beauty’s reign; / But wide the terrains were those levels serve.

02.11_071:010 - In front of the ascending epiphany / World-Time’s enjoyers, favourites of World-Bliss, / The Masters of things actual, lords of the hours, / Playmates of youthful Nature and child God, / Creators of Matter by hid stress of Mind / Whose subtle thoughts support unconscious Life / And guide the fantasy of brute events, / Stood there, a race of young keen-visioned Gods, / King-children born on Wisdom’s early plane, / Taught in her school world-making’s mystic play.

02.11_071:011 - Arch-masons of the eternal Thaumaturge, / Moulders and measurers of fragmented space, / They have made their plan of the concealed and known / A dwelling-house for the invisible King.

02.11_071:012 - Obeying the Eternal’s deep command / They have built in the material front of things / This wide world-kindergarten of young souls / Where the infant spirit learns through mind and sense / To read the letters of the cosmic script / And study the body of the cosmic self / And search for the secret meaning of the whole.

02.11_071:013 - To all that Spirit conceives they give a mould; / Persuading Nature into visible moods / They lend a finite shape to infinite things.

02.11_071:014 - Each power that leaps from the Unmanifest / Leaving the largeness of the Eternal’s peace / They seized and held by their precisian eye / And made a figurante in the cosmic dance: / Its free caprice they bound by rhythmic laws / And compelled to accept its posture and its line / In the wizardry of an ordered universe.

02.11_071:015 - The All-containing was contained in form, / Oneness was carved into units measurable, / The limitless built into a cosmic sum: / Unending Space was beaten into a curve, / Indivisible Time into small minutes cut, / The infinitesimal massed to keep secure / The mystery of the Formless cast into form.

02.11_071:016 - Invincibly their craft devised for use / The magic of sequent number and sign’s spell, / Design’s miraculous potency was caught / Laden with beauty and significance / And by the determining mandate of their gaze / Figure and quality equating joined / In an inextricable identity.

02.11_071:017 - On each event they stamped its curves of law / And its trust and charge of burdened circumstance; / A free and divine incident no more / At each moment willed or adventure of the soul, / A line foreseen of an immutable plan, / It lengthened a fate-bound mysterious chain, / One step more in Necessity’s long march.

02.11_071:018 - A term was set for every eager Power / Restraining its will to monopolise the world, / A groove of bronze prescribed for force and act / And shown to each moment its appointed place / Forewilled inalterably in the spiral / Huge Time-loop fugitive from eternity.

02.11_071:019 - Inevitable their thoughts like links of Fate / Imposed on the leap and lightning race of mind / And on the frail fortuitous flux of life / And on the liberty of atomic things / Immutable cause and adamant consequence.

02.11_071:020 - Idea gave up the plastic infinity / To which it was born and now traced out instead / Small separate steps of chain-work in a plot: / Immortal once, now tied to birth and end, / Torn from its immediacy of errorless sight, / Knowledge was rebuilt from cells of inference / Into a fixed body flasque and perishable; / Thus bound it grew, but could not last and broke / And to a new thinking’s body left its place.

02.11_071:021 - A cage for the Infinite’s great-eyed seraphim Thoughts / Was closed with a criss-cross of world-laws for bars / And hedged into a curt horizon’s arc / The irised vision of the Ineffable.

02.11_071:022 - A timeless Spirit was made the slave of the hours; / The Unbound was cast into a prison of birth / To make a world that Mind could grasp and rule.

02.11_071:023 - On an earth which looked towards a thousand suns, / That the created might grow Nature’s lord / And Matter’s depths be illumined with a soul / They tied to date and norm and finite scope / The million-mysteried movement of the One.

02.11_071:024 -     Above stood ranked a subtle archangel race / With larger lids and looks that searched the unseen.

02.11_071:025 - A light of liberating Knowledge shone / Across the gulfs of silence in their eyes; / They lived in the mind and knew truth from within; / A sight withdrawn in the concentrated heart / Could pierce behind the screen of Time’s results / And the rigid cast and shape of visible things.

02.11_071:026 - All that escaped conception’s narrow noose / Vision descried and gripped; their seeing thoughts / Filled in the blanks left by the seeking sense.

02.11_071:027 - High architects of possibility / And engineers of the impossible, / Mathematicians of the infinitudes / And theoricians of unknowable truths, / They formulate enigma’s postulates / And join the unknown to the apparent worlds.

02.11_071:028 - Acolytes they wait upon the timeless Power, / The cycle of her works investigate; / Passing her fence of wordless privacy / Their mind could penetrate her occult mind / And draw the diagram of her secret thoughts; / They read the codes and ciphers she had sealed, / Copies they made of all her guarded plans, / For every turn of her mysterious course / Assigned a reason and unchanging rule.

02.11_071:029 - The Unseen grew visible to student eyes, / Explained was the immense Inconscient’s scheme, / Audacious lines were traced upon the Void; / The Infinite was reduced to square and cube.

02.11_071:030 - Arranging symbol and significance, / Tracing the curve of a transcendent Power, / They framed the cabbala of the cosmic Law, / The balancing line discovered of Life’s technique / And structured her magic and her mystery.

02.11_071:031 - Imposing schemes of knowledge on the Vast / They clamped to syllogisms of finite thought / The free logic of an infinite consciousness, / Grammared the hidden rhythms of Nature’s dance, / Critiqued the plot of the drama of the worlds, / Made figure and number a key to all that is: / The psycho-analysis of cosmic Self / Was traced, its secrets hunted down, and read / The unknown pathology of the Unique.

02.11_071:032 - Assessed was the system of the probable, / The hazard of fleeing possibilities, / To account for the Actual’s unaccountable sum, / Necessity’s logarithmic tables drawn, / Cast into a scheme the triple act of the One.

02.11_071:033 - Unveiled, the abrupt invisible multitude / Of forces whirling from the hands of Chance / Seemed to obey some vast imperative: / Their tangled motives worked out unity.

02.11_071:034 - A wisdom read their mind to themselves unknown, / Their anarchy rammed into a formula / And from their giant randomness of Force, / Following the habit of their million paths, / Distinguishing each faintest line and stroke / Of a concealed unalterable design, / Out of the chaos of the Invisible’s moods / Derived the calculus of Destiny.

02.11_071:035 - In its bright pride of universal lore / Mind’s knowledge overtopped the Omniscient’s power: / The Eternal’s winging eagle puissances / Surprised in their untracked empyrean / Stooped from their gyres to obey the beck of Thought: / Each mysteried God forced to revealing form, / Assigned his settled moves in Nature’s game, / Zigzagged at the gesture of a chess-player Will / Across the chequer-board of cosmic Fate.

02.11_071:036 - In the wide sequence of Necessity’s steps / Predicted, every act and thought of God, / Its values weighed by the accountant Mind, / Checked in his mathematised omnipotence, / Lost its divine aspect of miracle / And was a figure in a cosmic sum.

02.11_071:037 - The mighty Mother’s whims and lightning moods / Arisen from her all-wise unruled delight / In the freedom of her sweet and passionate breast, / Robbed of their wonder were chained to a cause and aim; / An idol of bronze replaced her mystic shape / That captures the movements of the cosmic vasts, / In the sketch precise of an ideal face / Forgotten was her eyelashes’ dream-print / Carrying on their curve infinity’s dreams, / Lost the alluring marvel of her eyes; / The surging wave-throbs of her vast sea-heart / They bound to a theorem of ordered beats: / Her deep designs which from herself she had veiled / Bowed self-revealed in their confessional.

02.11_071:038 - For the birth and death of the worlds they fixed a date, / The diameter of Infinity was drawn, / Measured the distant arc of the unseen heights / And visualised the plumbless viewless depths / Till all seemed known that in all time could be.

02.11_071:039 - All was coerced by number, name and form; / Nothing was left untold, incalculable.

02.11_071:040 - Yet was their wisdom circled with a nought: / Truths they could find and hold but not the one Truth: / The Highest was to them unknowable.

02.11_071:041 - By knowing too much they missed the Whole to be known: / The fathomless heart of the world was left unguessed / And the Transcendent kept its secrecy.

02.11_071:042 -     In a sublimer and more daring soar / To the wide summit of the triple stairs / Bare steps climbed up like glowing rocks of gold / Burning their way to a pure absolute sky.

02.11_071:043 - August and few the sovereign Kings of Thought / Have made of Space their wide all-seeing gaze / Surveying the enormous work of Time: / A breadth of all-containing consciousness / Supported Being in a still embrace.

02.11_071:044 - Intercessors with a luminous Unseen, / They capt in the long passage to the world / The imperatives of the creator Self / Obeyed by unknowing earth, by conscious heaven; / Their thoughts are partners in its vast control.

02.11_071:045 - A great all-ruling consciousness is there / And Mind unwitting serves a higher Power; / It is a channel, not the source of all.

02.11_071:046 - The cosmos is no accident in Time; / There is a meaning in each play of Chance, / There is a freedom in each face of Fate.

02.11_071:047 - A Wisdom knows and guides the mysteried world; / A Truth-gaze shapes its beings and events; / A Word self-born upon creation’s heights, / Voice of the Eternal in the temporal spheres, / Prophet of the seeings of the Absolute, / Sows the Idea’s significance in Form / And from that seed the growths of Time arise.

02.11_071:048 - On peaks beyond our ken the All-Wisdom sits: / A single and infallible look comes down, / A silent touch from the supernal’s air / Awakes to ignorant knowledge in its acts / The secret power in the inconscient depths, / Compelling the blinded Godhead to emerge, / Determining Necessity’s rude dance / As she passes through the circuit of the hours / And vanishes from the chase of finite eyes / Down circling vistas of aeonic Time.

02.11_071:049 - The unseizable forces of the cosmic whirl / Bear in their bacchant limbs the fixity / Of an original foresight that is Fate.

02.11_071:050 - Even Nature’s ignorance is Truth’s instrument; / Our struggling ego cannot change her course: / Yet is it a conscious power that moves in us / And destiny the unrecognised child of Will.

02.11_071:051 - Infallibly by Truth’s directing gaze / All creatures here their secret self disclose, / Forced to become what in themselves they hide.

02.11_071:052 - For He who is grows manifest in the years / And the slow Godhead shut within the cell / Climbs from the plasm to immortality.

02.11_071:053 - But hidden, but denied to mortal grasp, / Mystic, ineffable is the Spirit’s truth, / Unspoken, caught only by the spirit’s eye.

02.11_071:054t - When naked of ego and mind it hears the Voice; / It looks through light to ever greater light / And sees Eternity ensphering Life. #divine-conditions #greater-mind #jnana-yoga #spiritual-sight #spiritual-vision #true-self #voice-of-god #yoga

02.11_071:055 - This greater Truth is foreign to our thoughts; / Where a free Wisdom works, they seek for a rule; / Or we only see a tripping game of Chance / Or a labour in chains forced by bound Nature’s law, / An absolutism of dumb unthinking Power.

02.11_071:056 - Audacious in their sense of God-born strength / These dared to grasp with their thought Truth’s absolute; / By an abstract purity of godless sight, / By a percept nude, intolerant of forms, / They brought to Mind what Mind could never reach / And hope to conquer Truth’s supernal base.

02.11_071:057 - A stripped imperative of conceptual phrase / Architectonic and inevitable / Translated the Unthinkable into thought: / A silver-winged fire of naked subtle sense, / An ear of mind withdrawn from the outward’s rhymes / Discovered the seed-sounds of the eternal Word, / The rhythm and music heard that built the worlds, / And seized in things the bodiless Will to be.

02.11_071:058 - The Illimitable they measured with number’s rods / And traced the last formula of limited things, / In transparent systems bodied termless truths, / The Timeless made accountable to Time / And valued the incommensurable Supreme.

02.11_071:059 - To park and hedge the ungrasped infinitudes / They erected absolute walls of thought and speech / And made a vacuum to hold the One.

02.11_071:060 - In their sight they drove towards an empty peak, / A mighty space of cold and sunlit air.

02.11_071:061 - To unify their task, excluding life / Which cannot bear the nakedness of the Vast, / They made a cipher of a multitude, / In negation found the meaning of the All / And in nothingness the absolute positive.

02.11_071:062 - A single law simplessed the cosmic theme, / Compressing Nature into a formula; / Their titan labour made all knowledge one, / A mental algebra of the Spirit’s ways, / An abstract of the living Divinity.

02.11_071:063 - Here the mind’s wisdom stopped; it felt complete; / For nothing more was left to think or know; / In a spiritual zero it sat throned / And took its vast silence for the Ineffable.


Section I - 72: bright gods of thought


02.11_072:001 - This was the play of the bright gods of Thought.

02.11_072:002 - Attracting into time the timeless Light, / Imprisoning eternity in the hours, / This they have planned, to snare the feet of Truth / In an aureate net of concept and of phrase / And keep her captive for the thinker’s joy / In his little world built of immortal dreams: / There must she dwell mured in the human mind, / An empress prisoner in her subject’s house, / Adored and pure and still on his heart’s throne, / His splendid property cherished and apart / In the wall of silence of his secret muse, / Immaculate in white virginity, / The same for ever and for ever one, / His worshipped changeless Goddess through all time.

02.11_072:003 - Or else, a faithful consort of his mind / Assenting to his nature and his will, / She sanctions and inspires his words and acts / Prolonging their resonance through the listening ears, / Companion and recorder of his march / Crossing a brilliant tract of thought and life / Carved out of the eternity of Time.

02.11_072:004 - A witness of his high triumphant star, / Her godhead servitor to a crowned Idea, / He shall dominate by her a prostrate world; / A warrant for his deeds and his beliefs, / She attests his right divine to lead and rule.

02.11_072:005 - Or as her lover clasps his one beloved, / Godhead of his life’s worship and desire, / Icon of his heart’s sole idolatry, / She now is his and must live for him alone: / She has invaded him with her sudden bliss, / An exhaustless marvel in his happy grasp, / An allurement, a caught ravishing miracle.

02.11_072:006 - Her now he claims after long rapt pursuit, / The one joy of his body and his soul: / Inescapable is her divine appeal, / Her immense possession an undying thrill, / An intoxication and an ecstasy: / The passion of her self-revealing moods, / A heavenly glory and variety, / Makes ever new her body to his eyes, / Or else repeats the first enchantment’s touch, / The luminous rapture of her mystic breasts / And beautiful vibrant limbs a living field / Of throbbing new discovery without end.

02.11_072:007 - A new beginning flowers in word and laugh, / A new charm brings back the old extreme delight: / He is lost in her, she is his heaven here.

02.11_072:008 - Truth smiled upon the gracious golden game.

02.11_072:009 - Out of her hushed eternal spaces leaned / The great and boundless Goddess feigned to yield / The sunlit sweetness of her secrecies.

02.11_072:010A - Incarnating her beauty in his clasp / She gave for a brief kiss her immortal lips / And drew to her bosom one glorified mortal head: / She made earth her home, for whom heaven was too small.

02.11_072:011A - In a human breast her occult presence lived; / He carved from his own self his figure of her: / She shaped her body to a mind’s embrace.

02.11_072:012 - Into thought’s narrow limits she has come; / Her greatness she has suffered to be pressed / Into the little cabin of the Idea, / The closed room of a lonely thinker’s grasp: / She has lowered her heights to the stature of our souls / And dazzled our lids with her celestial gaze.

02.11_072:013 - Thus each is satisfied with his high gain / And thinks himself beyond mortality blest, / A king of truth upon his separate throne.

02.11_072:014 - To her possessor in the field of Time / A single splendour caught from her glory seems / The one true light, her beauty’s glowing whole.

02.11_072:015 - But thought nor word can seize eternal Truth: / The whole world lives in a lonely ray of her sun.

02.11_072:016 - In our thinking’s close and narrow lamp-lit house / The vanity of our shut mortal mind / Dreams that the chains of thought have made her ours; / But only we play with our own brilliant bonds; / Tying her down, it is ourselves we tie.

02.11_072:017 - In our hypnosis by one luminous point / We see not what small figure of her we hold; / We feel not her inspiring boundlessness, / We share not her immortal liberty.

02.11_072:018 - Thus is it even with the seer and sage; / For still the human limits the divine: / Out of our thoughts we must leap up to sight, / Breathe her divine illimitable air, / Her simple vast supremacy confess, / Dare to surrender to her absolute.

02.11_072:019 - Then the Unmanifest reflects his form / In the still mind as in a living glass; / The timeless Ray descends into our hearts / And we are rapt into eternity.

02.11_072:020 - For Truth is wider, greater than her forms.

02.11_072:021At - A thousand icons they have made of her / And find her in the idols they adore; / But she remains herself and infinite. #divine-beloved #divine-shakti #god-in-all #gods-of-thought #infinite-goddess #jnana-bhakti #lilamaya #transcendent-goddess


Canto 12 - 2.12: The Heavens of the Ideal

Section I - 73: temple ground


02.12_073:001t - Always the Ideal beckoned from afar. #greater-mind #heavens-of-the-ideal #ideal #potential

02.12_073:002 - Awakened by the touch of the Unseen, / Deserting the boundary of things achieved, / Aspired the strong discoverer, tireless Thought, / Revealing at each step a luminous world.

02.12_073:003 - It left known summits for the unknown peaks: / Impassioned, it sought the lone unrealised Truth, / It longed for the Light that knows not death and birth.

02.12_073:004 - Each stage of the soul’s remote ascent was built / Into a constant heaven felt always here.

02.12_073:005 - At each pace of the journey marvellous / A new degree of wonder and of bliss, / A new rung formed in Being’s mighty stair, / A great wide step trembling with jewelled fire / As if a burning spirit quivered there / Upholding with his flame the immortal hope, / As if a radiant God had given his soul / That he might feel the tread of pilgrim feet / Mounting in haste to the Eternal’s house.

02.12_073:006 - At either end of each effulgent stair / The heavens of the ideal Mind were seen / In a blue lucency of dreaming space / Like strips of brilliant sky clinging to the moon.

02.12_073:007 - On one side glimmered hue on floating hue, / In a glory and surprise of the seized soul / And a tremulous rapture of the heart’s insight / And the spontaneous bliss that beauty gives, / The lovely kingdoms of the deathless Rose.

02.12_073:008 - Above the spirit cased in mortal sense / Are superconscious realms of heavenly peace, / Below, the Inconscient’s sullen dim abyss, / Between, behind our life, the deathless Rose.

02.12_073:009 - Across the covert air the spirit breathes, / A body of the cosmic beauty and joy / Unseen, unguessed by the blind suffering world, / Climbing from Nature’s deep surrendered heart / It blooms for ever at the feet of God, / Fed by life’s sacrificial mysteries.

02.12_073:010Bt - Here too its bud is born in human breasts; / Then by a touch, a presence or a voice / The world is turned into a temple ground / And all discloses the unknown Beloved. #divine-effect #divinization #glory #heavens-of-the-ideal #revelation #santification #the-beloved

02.12_073:011 - In an outburst of heavenly joy and ease / Life yields to the divinity within / And gives the rapture-offering of its all, / And the soul opens to felicity.

02.12_073:012 - A bliss is felt that never can wholly cease, / A sudden mystery of secret Grace / Flowers goldening our earth of red desire.

02.12_073:013 - All the high gods who hid their visages / From the soiled passionate ritual of our hopes, / Reveal their names and their undying powers.

02.12_073:014 - A fiery stillness wakes the slumbering cells, / A passion of the flesh becoming spirit, / And marvellously is fulfilled at last / The miracle for which our life was made.

02.12_073:015 - A flame in a white voiceless cupola / Is seen and faces of immortal light, / The radiant limbs that know not birth and death, / The breasts that suckle the first-born of the Sun, / The wings that crowd Thought’s ardent silences, / The eyes that look into spiritual Space.

02.12_073:016 - Our hidden centres of celestial force / Open like flowers to a heavenly atmosphere; / Mind pauses thrilled with the supernal Ray, / And even the transient body then can feel / Ideal love and flawless happiness / And laughter of the heart’s sweetness and delight / Freed from the rude and tragic hold of Time, / And beauty and the rhythmic feet of the hours.

02.12_073:017 - This in high realms touches immortal kind; / What here is in the bud has blossomed there.

02.12_073:018 - There is the secrecy of the House of Flame, / The blaze of Godlike thought and golden bliss, / The rapt idealism of heavenly sense; / There are the wonderful voices, the sun-laugh, / A gurgling eddy in rivers of God’s joy, / And the mysteried vineyards of the gold moon-wine, / All the fire and sweetness of which hardly here / A brilliant shadow visits mortal life.

02.12_073:019 - Although are witnessed there the joys of Time, / Pressed on the bosom the Immortal’s touch is felt, / Heard are the flutings of the Infinite.

02.12_073:020 - Here upon earth are early awakenings, / Moments that tremble in an air divine, / And grown upon the yearning of her soil / Time’s sun-flowers’ gaze at gold Eternity: / There are the imperishable beatitudes.

02.12_073:021 - A million lotuses swaying on one stem, / World after coloured and ecstatic world / Climbs towards some far unseen epiphany.

02.12_073:022 - On the other side of the eternal stairs / The mighty kingdoms of the deathless Flame / Aspired to reach the Being’s absolutes.

02.12_073:023 - Out of the sorrow and darkness of the world, / Out of the depths where life and thought are tombed, / Lonely mounts up to heaven the deathless Flame.

02.12_073:024 - In a veiled Nature’s hallowed secrecies / It burns for ever on the altar Mind, / Its priests the souls of dedicated gods, / Humanity its house of sacrifice.

02.12_073:025 - Once kindled never can its flamings cease.

02.12_073:026 - A fire along the mystic paths of earth / It rises through the mortal’s hemisphere, / Till borne by runners of the Day and Dusk / It enters the occult eternal Light / And clambers whitening to the invisible Throne.

02.12_073:027 - Its worlds are steps of an ascending Force: / A dream of giant contours, titan lines, / Homes of unfallen and illumined Might, / Heavens of unchanging Good pure and unborn, / Heights of the grandeur of Truth’s ageless ray, / As in a symbol sky they start to view / And call our souls into a vaster air.

02.12_073:028 - On their summits they bear up the sleepless Flame; / Dreaming of a mysterious Beyond, / Transcendent of the paths of Fate and Time, / They point above themselves with index peaks / Through a pale-sapphire ether of God-mind / Towards some gold Infinite’s apocalypse.

02.12_073:029 - A thunder rolling mid the hills of God, / Tireless, severe is their tremendous Voice: / Exceeding us, to exceed ourselves they call / And bid us rise incessantly above.

02.12_073:030 - Far from our eager reach those summits live, / Too lofty for our mortal strength and height, / Hardly in a dire ecstasy of toil / Climbed by the spirit’s naked athlete will.

02.12_073:031 - Austere, intolerant they claim from us / Efforts too lasting for our mortal nerve / Our hearts cannot cleave to nor our flesh support; / Only the Eternal’s strength in us can dare / To attempt the immense adventure of that climb / And the sacrifice of all we cherish here.

02.12_073:032 - Our human knowledge is a candle burnt / On a dim altar to a sun-vast Truth; / Man’s virtue, a coarse-spun ill-fitting dress, / Apparels wooden images of Good; / Passionate and blinded, bleeding, stained with mire / His energy stumbles towards a deathless Force.

02.12_073:033 - An imperfection dogs our highest strength; / Portions and pale reflections are our share.

02.12_073:034 - Happy the worlds that have not felt our fall, / Where Will is one with Truth and Good with Power; / Impoverished not by earth-mind’s indigence, / They keep God’s natural breath of mightiness, / His bare spontaneous swift intensities; / There is his great transparent mirror, Self, / And there his sovereign autarchy of bliss / In which immortal natures have their part, / Heirs and co-sharers of divinity.

02.12_073:035 - He through the Ideal’s kingdoms moved at will, / Accepted their beauty and their greatness bore, / Partook of the glories of their wonder fields, / But passed nor stayed beneath their splendour’s rule.

02.12_073:036 - All there was an intense but partial light.

02.12_073:037 - In each a seraph-winged high-browed Idea / United all knowledge by one master thought, / Persuaded all action to one golden sense, / All powers subjected to a single power / And made a world where it could reign alone, / An absolute ideal’s perfect home.

02.12_073:038B - Insignia of their victory and their faith, / They offered to the Traveller at their gates / A quenchless flame or an unfading flower, / Emblem of a high kingdom’s privilege.

02.12_073:039 - A glorious shining Angel of the Way / Presented to the seeking of the soul / The sweetness and the might of an idea, / Each deemed Truth’s intimate fount and summit force, / The heart of the meaning of the universe, / Perfection’s key, passport to Paradise.

02.12_073:040 - Yet were there regions where these absolutes met / And made a circle of bliss with married hands; / Light stood embraced by light, fire wedded fire, / But none in the other would his body lose / To find his soul in the world’s single Soul, / A multiplied rapture of infinity.

02.12_073:041 - Onward he passed to a diviner sphere: / There, joined in a common greatness, light and bliss, / All high and beautiful and desirable powers / Forgetting their difference and their separate reign / Become a single multitudinous whole.

02.12_073:042 - Above the parting of the roads of Time, / Above the Silence and its thousandfold Word, / In the immutable and inviolate Truth / For ever united and inseparable, / The radiant children of Eternity dwell / On the wide spirit height where all are one.


Canto 13 - 2.13: In the Self of Mind

Section I - 74: self of mind


02.13_074:001 - At last there came a bare indifferent sky / Where Silence listened to the cosmic Voice, / But answered nothing to a million calls; / The soul’s endless question met with no response.

02.13_074:002 - An abrupt conclusion ended eager hopes, / A deep cessation in a mighty calm, / A finis-line on the last page of thought / And a margin and a blank of wordless peace.

02.13_074:003 - There paused the climbing hierarchy of worlds.

02.13_074:004 - He stood on a wide arc of summit Space / Alone with an enormous Self of Mind / Which held all life in a corner of its vasts.

02.13_074:005 - Omnipotent, immobile and aloof, / In the world which sprang from it, it took no part: / It gave no heed to the paeans of victory, / It was indifferent to its own defeats, / It heard the cry of grief and made no sign, / Impartial fell its gaze on evil and good, / It saw destruction come and did not move.

02.13_074:006 - An equal Cause of things, a lonely Seer / And Master of its multitude of forms, / It acted not but bore all thoughts and deeds, / The witness Lord of Nature’s myriad acts / Consenting to the movements of her Force.

02.13_074:007 - His mind reflected this vast quietism.

02.13_074:008 - This witness hush is the Thinker’s secret base: / Hidden in silent depths the word is formed, / From hidden silences the act is born / Into the voiceful mind, the labouring world; / In secrecy wraps the seed the Eternal sows / Silence, the mystic birthplace of the soul.

02.13_074:009 - In God’s supreme withdrawn and timeless hush / A seeing Self and potent Energy met; / The Silence knew itself and thought took form: / Self-made from the dual power creation rose.

02.13_074:010 - In the still self he lived and it in him; / Its mute immemorable listening depths, / Its vastness and its stillness were his own; / One being with it he grew wide, powerful, free.

02.13_074:011 - As one who builds his own imagined scenes / And loses not himself in what he sees, / Spectator of a drama self-conceived, / He looked on the world and watched its motive thoughts / With the burden of luminous prophecy in their eyes, / Its forces with their feet of wind and fire / Arisen from the dumbness in his soul.

02.13_074:012 - All now he seemed to understand and know; / Desire came not nor any gust of will, / The great perturbed inquirer lost his task; / Nothing was asked nor wanted any more.

02.13_074:013 - There he could stay, the Self, the Silence won: / His soul had peace, it knew the cosmic Whole.

02.13_074:014 - Then suddenly a luminous finger fell / On all things seen or touched or heard or felt / And showed his mind that nothing could be known; / That must be reached from which all knowledge comes.

02.13_074:015 - The sceptic Ray disrupted all that seems / And smote at the very roots of thought and sense.

02.13_074:016 - In a universe of Nescience they have grown, / Aspiring towards a superconscient Sun, / Playing in shine and rain from heavenlier skies / They never can win however high their reach / Or overpass however keen their probe.

02.13_074:017 - A doubt corroded even the means to think, / Distrust was thrown upon Mind’s instruments; / All that it takes for reality’s shining coin, / Proved fact, fixed inference, deduction clear, / Firm theory, assured significance, / Appeared as frauds upon Time’s credit bank / Or assets valueless in Truth’s treasury.

02.13_074:018 - An Ignorance on an uneasy throne / Travestied with a fortuitous sovereignty / A figure of knowledge garbed in dubious words / And tinsel thought-forms brightly inadequate.

02.13_074:019 - A labourer in the dark dazzled by half-light, / What it knew was an image in a broken glass, / What it saw was real but its sight untrue.

02.13_074:020 - All the ideas in its vast repertory / Were like the mutterings of a transient cloud / That spent itself in sound and left no trace.

02.13_074:021 - A frail house hanging in uncertain air, / The thin ingenious web round which it moves, / Put out awhile on the tree of the universe, / And gathered up into itself again, / Was only a trap to catch life’s insect food, / Winged thoughts that flutter fragile in brief light / But dead, once captured in fixed forms of mind, / Aims puny but looming large in man’s small scale, / Flickers, of imagination’s brilliant gauze / And cobweb-wrapped beliefs alive no more.

02.13_074:022 - The magic hut of built-up certitudes / Made out of glittering dust and bright moonshine / In which it shrines its image of the Real, / Collapsed into the Nescience whence it rose.

02.13_074:023 - Only a gleam was there of symbol facts / That shroud the mystery lurking in their glow, / And falsehoods based on hidden realities / By which they live until they fall from Time.

02.13_074:024 - Our mind is a house haunted by the slain past, / Ideas soon mummified, ghosts of old truths, / God’s spontaneities tied with formal strings / And packed into drawers of reason’s trim bureau, / A grave of great lost opportunities, / Or an office for misuse of soul and life / And all the waste man makes of heaven’s gifts / And all his squanderings of Nature’s store, / A stage for the comedy of Ignorance.

02.13_074:025 - The world seemed a long aeonic failure’s scene: / All sterile grew, no base was left secure.

02.13_074:026 - Assailed by the edge of the convicting beam / The builder Reason lost her confidence / In the successful sleight and turn of thought / That makes the soul the prisoner of a phrase.

02.13_074:027 - Its highest wisdom was a brilliant guess, / Its mighty structured science of the worlds / A passing light on being’s surfaces.

02.13_074:028 - There was nothing there but a schema drawn by sense, / A substitute for eternal mysteries, / A scrawl figure of reality, a plan / And elevation by the architect Word / Imposed upon the semblances of Time.

02.13_074:029 - Existence’ self was shadowed by a doubt; / Almost it seemed a lotus-leaf afloat / On a nude pool of cosmic Nothingness.

02.13_074:030 - This great spectator and creator Mind / Was only some half-seeing’s delegate, / A veil that hung between the soul and Light, / An idol, not the living body of God.

02.13_074:031 - Even the still spirit that looks upon its works / Was some pale front of the Unknowable; / A shadow seemed the wide and witness Self, / Its liberation and immobile calm / A void recoil of being from Time-made things, / Not the self-vision of Eternity.

02.13_074:032 - Deep peace was there, but not the nameless Force: / Our sweet and mighty Mother was not there / Who gathers to her bosom her children’s lives, / Her clasp that takes the world into her arms / In the fathomless rapture of the Infinite, / The Bliss that is creation’s splendid grain / Or the white passion of God-ecstasy / That laughs in the blaze of the boundless heart of Love.

02.13_074:033 - A greater Spirit than the Self of Mind / Must answer to the questioning of his soul.

02.13_074:034 - For here was no firm clue and no sure road; / High-climbing pathways closed in the unknown; / An artist sight constructed the Beyond / In contrary patterns and conflicting hues; / A part-experience fragmented the Whole.

02.13_074:035 - He looked above, but all was blank and still; / A sapphire firmament of abstract Thought / Escaped into a formless Vacancy.

02.13_074:036 - He looked below, but all was dark and mute.

02.13_074:037 - A noise was heard, between, of thought and prayer, / A strife, a labour without end or pause; / A vain and ignorant seeking raised its voice.

02.13_074:038 - A rumour and a movement and a call, / A foaming mass, a cry innumerable / Rolled ever upon the ocean surge of Life / Along the coasts of mortal Ignorance.

02.13_074:039 - On its unstable and enormous breast / Beings and forces, forms, ideas like waves / Jostled for figure and supremacy, / And rose and sank and rose again in Time, / And at the bottom of the sleepless stir, / A Nothingness parent of the struggling worlds, / A huge creator Death, a mystic Void, / For ever sustaining the irrational cry, / For ever excluding the supernal Word, / Motionless, refusing question and response, / Reposed beneath the voices and the march / The dim Inconscient’s dumb incertitude.

02.13_074:040 - Two firmaments of darkness and of light / Opposed their limits to the spirit’s walk; / It moved veiled in from Self’s infinity / In a world of beings and momentary events / Where all must die to live and live to die.

02.13_074:041 - Immortal by renewed mortality, / It wandered in the spiral of its acts / Or ran around the cycles of its thought, / Yet was no more than its original self / And knew no more than when it first began.

02.13_074:042 - To be was a prison, extinction the escape.


Canto 14 - 2.14: The World-Soul

Section I - 75: measureless secure infinity


02.14_075:001 - A covert answer to his seeking came.

02.14_075:002 - In a far-shimmering background of Mind-Space / A glowing mouth was seen, a luminous shaft; / A recluse-gate it seemed, musing on joy, / A veiled retreat and escape to mystery.

02.14_075:003 - Away from the unsatisfied surface world / It fled into the bosom of the unknown, / A well, a tunnel of the depths of God.

02.14_075:004 - It plunged as if a mystic groove of hope / Through many layers of formless voiceless self / To reach the last profound of the world’s heart, / And from that heart there surged a wordless call / Pleading with some still impenetrable Mind, / Voicing some passionate unseen desire.

02.14_075:005 - As if a beckoning finger of secrecy / Outstretched into a crystal mood of air, / Pointing at him from some near hidden depth, / As if a message from the world’s deep soul, / An intimation of a lurking joy / That flowed out from a cup of brooding bliss, / There shimmered stealing out into the Mind / A mute and quivering ecstasy of light, / A passion and delicacy of roseate fire.

02.14_075:006 - As one drawn to his lost spiritual home / Feels now the closeness of a waiting love, / Into a passage dim and tremulous / That clasped him in from day and night’s pursuit, / He travelled led by a mysterious sound.

02.14_075:007 - A murmur, multitudinous and lone, / All sounds it was in turn, yet still the same.

02.14_075:008 - A hidden call to unforeseen delight / In the summoning voice of one long-known and loved, / But nameless to the unremembering mind, / It led to rapture back the truant heart.

02.14_075:009 - The immortal cry ravished the captive ear, / Then, lowering its imperious mystery, / It sank to a whisper circling round the soul.

02.14_075:010 - It seemed the yearning of a lonely flute / That roamed along the shores of memory / And filled the eyes with tears of longing joy.

02.14_075:011 - A cricket’s rash and fiery single note, / It marked with shrill melody night’s moonless hush / And beat upon a nerve of mystic sleep / Its high insistent magical reveille.

02.14_075:012 - A jingling silver laugh of anklet bells / Travelled the roads of a solitary heart; / Its dance solaced an eternal loneliness: / An old forgotten sweetness sobbing came.

02.14_075:013 - Or from a far harmonious distance heard / The tinkling pace of a long caravan / It seemed at times, or a vast forest’s hymn, / The solemn reminder of a temple gong, / A bee-croon honey-drunk in summer isles / Ardent with ecstasy in a slumberous noon, / Or the far anthem of a pilgrim sea.

02.14_075:014 - An incense floated in the quivering air, / A mystic happiness trembled in the breast / As if the invisible Beloved had come / Assuming the sudden loveliness of a face / And close glad hands could seize his fugitive feet / And the world change with the beauty of a smile.

02.14_075:015 - Into a wonderful bodiless realm he came, / The home of a passion without name or voice, / A depth he felt answering to every height, / A nook was found that could embrace all worlds, / A point that was the conscious knot of space, / An hour eternal in the heart of Time.

02.14_075:016 - The silent soul of all the world was there: / A Being lived, a Presence and a Power, / A single Person who was himself and all / And cherished Nature’s sweet and dangerous throbs / Transfigured into beats divine and pure.

02.14_075:017 - One who could love without return for love, / Meeting and turning to the best the worst, / It healed the bitter cruelties of earth / Transforming all experience to delight; / Intervening in the sorrowful paths of birth / It rocked the cradle of the cosmic Child / And stilled all weeping with its hand of joy; / It led things evil towards their secret good, / It turned racked falsehood into happy truth; / Its power was to reveal divinity.

02.14_075:018 - Infinite, coeval with the mind of God, / It bore within itself a seed, a flame, / A seed from which the Eternal is new-born, / A flame that cancels death in mortal things.

02.14_075:019 - All grew to all kindred and self and near, / The intimacy of God was everywhere, / No veil was felt, no brute barrier inert, / Distance could not divide, Time could not change.

02.14_075:020 - A fire of passion burned in spirit-depths, / A constant touch of sweetness linked all hearts, / The throb of one adoration’s single bliss / In a rapt ether of undying love.

02.14_075:021 - An inner happiness abode in all, / A sense of universal harmonies, / A measureless secure eternity / Of truth and beauty and good and joy made one.

02.14_075:022 - There was the welling core of finite life; / A formless spirit became the soul of form.



Section I - 76: all there was soul


02.14_076:001 - All there was soul or made of sheer soul-stuff: / A sky of soul covered a deep soul-ground.

02.14_076:002 - All here was known by a spiritual sense: / Thought was not there but a knowledge near and one / Seized on all things by a moved identity, / A sympathy of self with other selves, / The touch of consciousness on consciousness / And being’s look on being with inmost gaze / And heart laid bare to heart without walls of speech / And the unanimity of seeing minds / In myriad forms luminous with the one God.

02.14_076:003 - Life was not there, but an impassioned force, / Finer than fineness, deeper than the deeps / Felt as a subtle and spiritual power, / A quivering out from soul to answering soul, / A mystic movement, a close influence, / A free and happy and intense approach / Of being to being with no screen or check, / Without which life and love could never have been.

02.14_076:004 - Body was not there, for bodies were needed not, / The soul itself was its own deathless form / And met at once the touch of other souls / Close, blissful, concrete, wonderfully true.

02.14_076:005 - As when one walks in sleep through luminous dreams / And, conscious, knows the truth their figures mean, / There where reality was its own dream, / He knew things by their soul and not their shape: / As those who have lived long made one in love / Need word nor sign for heart’s reply to heart, / He met and communed without bar of speech / With beings unveiled by a material frame.

02.14_076:006 - There was a strange spiritual scenery, / A loveliness of lakes and streams and hills, / A flow, a fixity in a soul-space, / And plains and valleys, stretches of soul-joy, / And gardens that were flower-tracts of the spirit, / Its meditations of tinged reverie.

02.14_076:007 - Air was the breath of a pure infinite.

02.14_076:008 - A fragrance wandered in a coloured haze / As if the scent and hue of all sweet flowers / Had mingled to copy heaven’s atmosphere.

02.14_076:009 - Appealing to the soul and not the eye / Beauty lived there at home in her own house, / There all was beautiful by its own right / And needed not the splendour of a robe.

02.14_076:010 - All objects were like bodies of the Gods, / A spirit symbol environing a soul, / For world and self were one reality.



Section I - 77: fashioning chamber of the gods


02.14_077:001 - Immersed in voiceless internatal trance / The beings that once wore forms on earth sat there / In shining chambers of spiritual sleep.

02.14_077:002 - Passed were the pillar-posts of birth and death, / Passed was their little scene of symbol deeds, / Passed were the heavens and hells of their long road; / They had returned into the world’s deep soul.

02.14_077:003 - All now was gathered into pregnant rest: / Person and nature suffered a slumber change.

02.14_077:004 - In trance they gathered back their bygone selves, / In a background memory’s foreseeing muse / Prophetic of new personality / Arranged the map of their coming destiny’s course: / Heirs of their past, their future’s discoverers, / Electors of their own self-chosen lot, / They waited for the adventure of new life.

02.14_077:005 - A Person persistent through the lapse of worlds, / Although the same for ever in many shapes / By the outward mind unrecognisable / Assuming names unknown in unknown climes / Imprints through Time upon the earth’s worn page / A growing figure of its secret self, / And learns by experience what the spirit knew, / Till it can see its truth alive and God.

02.14_077:006 - Once more they must face the problem-game of birth, / The soul’s experiment of joy and grief / And thought and impulse lighting the blind act, / And venture on the roads of circumstance / Through inner movements and external scenes / Travelling to self across the forms of things.

02.14_077:007 - Into creation’s centre he had come.

02.14_077:008 - The spirit wandering from state to state / Finds here the silence of its starting-point / In the formless force and the still fixity / And brooding passion of the world of Soul.

02.14_077:009 - All that is made and once again unmade, / The calm persistent vision of the One / Inevitably re-makes, it lives anew: / Forces and lives and beings and ideas / Are taken into the stillness for a while; / There they remould their purpose and their drift, / Recast their nature and re-form their shape.

02.14_077:010 - Ever they change and changing ever grow, / And passing through a fruitful stage of death / And after long reconstituting sleep / Resume their place in the process of the Gods / Until their work in cosmic Time is done.

02.14_077:011 -     Here was the fashioning chamber of the worlds.

02.14_077:012 - An interval was left twixt act and act, / Twixt birth and birth, twixt dream and waking dream, / A pause that gave new strength to do and be.

02.14_077:013 - Beyond were regions of delight and peace, / Mute birth-places of light and hope and love, / And cradles of heavenly rapture and repose.

02.14_077:014 - In a slumber of the voices of the world / He of the eternal moment grew aware; / His knowledge stripped bare of the garbs of sense / Knew by identity without thought or word, / His being saw itself without its veils, / Life’s line fell from the spirit’s infinity.

02.14_077:015 - Along a road of pure interior light, / Alone between tremendous Presences, / Under the watching eye of nameless Gods, / His soul passed on, a single conscious power / Towards the end which ever begins again, / Approaching through a stillness dumb and calm / To the source of all things human and divine.

02.14_077:016 - There he beheld in their mighty union’s poise / The figure of the deathless Two-in-One, / A single being in two bodies clasped, / A diarchy of two united souls, / Seated absorbed in deep creative joy; / Their trance of bliss sustained the mobile world.

02.14_077:017 - Behind them in a morning dusk One stood / Who brought them forth from the Unknowable.

02.14_077:018 - Ever disguised she awaits the seeking spirit; / Watcher on the supreme unreachable peaks, / Guide of the traveller of the unseen paths, / She guards the austere approach to the Alone.

02.14_077:019 - At the beginning of each far-spread plane / Pervading with her power the cosmic suns / She reigns, inspirer of its multiple works / And thinker of the symbol of its scene.

02.14_077:020 - Above them all she stands supporting all, / The sole omnipotent Goddess ever-veiled / Of whom the world is the inscrutable mask; / The ages are the footfalls of her tread, / Their happenings the figure of her thoughts, / And all creation is her endless act.

02.14_077:021 - His spirit was made a vessel of her force; / Mute in the fathomless passion of his will / He outstretched to her his folded hands of prayer.

02.14_077:022 - Then in a sovereign answer to his heart / A gesture came as of worlds thrown away, / And from her raiment’s lustrous mystery raised / One arm half-parted the eternal veil.

02.14_077:023 - A light appeared still and imperishable.

02.14_077:024 - Attracted to the large and luminous depths / Of the ravishing enigma of her eyes, / He saw the mystic outline of a face.

02.14_077:025 - Overwhelmed by her implacable light and bliss, / An atom of her illimitable self / Mastered by the honey and lightning of her power, / Tossed towards the shores of her ocean ecstasy, / Drunk with a deep golden spiritual wine, / He cast from the rent stillness of his soul / A cry of adoration and desire / And the surrender of his boundless mind / And the self-giving of his silent heart.

02.14_077:026 - He fell down at her feet unconscious, prone.


Canto 15 - 2.15: The Kingdoms of the Greater Knowledge

Section I - 78: golden ridge


02.15_078:001 - After a measureless moment of the soul / Again returning to these surface fields / Out of the timeless depths where he had sunk, / He heard once more the slow tread of the hours.

02.15_078:002 - All once perceived and lived was far away; / Himself was to himself his only scene.

02.15_078:003 - Above the Witness and his universe / He stood in a realm of boundless silences / Awaiting the Voice that spoke and built the worlds.

02.15_078:004 - A light was round him wide and absolute, / A diamond purity of eternal sight; / A consciousness lay still, devoid of forms, / Free, wordless, uncoerced by sign or rule, / For ever content with only being and bliss; / A sheer existence lived in its own peace / On the single spirit’s bare and infinite ground.

02.15_078:005 - Out of the sphere of Mind he had arisen, / He had left the reign of Nature’s hues and shades; / He dwelt in his self’s colourless purity.

02.15_078:006 - It was a plane of undetermined spirit / That could be a zero or round sum of things, / A state in which all ceased and all began.

02.15_078:007 - All it became that figures the absolute, / A high vast peak whence spirit could see the worlds, / Calm’s wide epiphany, wisdom’s mute home, / A lonely station of Omniscience, / A diving-board of the Eternal’s power, / A white floor in the house of All-Delight.

02.15_078:008 - Here came the thought that passes beyond Thought, / Here the still Voice which our listening cannot hear, / The Knowledge by which the Knower is the Known, / The Love in which Beloved and Lover are one.

02.15_078:009 - All stood in an original plenitude, / Hushed and fulfilled before they could create / The glorious dream of their universal acts; / Here was engendered the spiritual birth, / Here closed the finite’s crawl to the Infinite.

02.15_078:010 - A thousand roads leaped into Eternity / Or singing ran to meet God’s veilless face.

02.15_078:011 - The known released him from its limiting chain, / He knocked at the doors of the Unknowable.

02.15_078:012 - Thence gazing with an immeasurable outlook / One with self’s inlook into its own pure vasts, / He saw the splendour of the spirit’s realms, / The greatness and wonder of its boundless works, / The power and passion leaping from its calm, / The rapture of its movement and its rest, / And its fire-sweet miracle of transcendent life, / The million-pointing undivided grasp / Of its vision of one same stupendous All, / Its inexhaustible acts in a timeless Time, / A space that is its own infinity.

02.15_078:013 - A glorious multiple of one radiant Self, / Answering to joy with joy, to love with love, / All there were moving mansions of God-bliss; / Eternal and unique they lived the One.

02.15_078:014 - There forces are great outbursts of God’s truth / And objects are its pure spiritual shapes; / Spirit no more is hid from its own view, / All sentience is a sea of happiness / And all creation is an act of light.

02.15_078:015 - Out of the neutral silence of his soul / He passed to its fields of puissance and of calm / And saw the Powers that stand above the world, / Traversed the realms of the supreme Idea / And sought the summit of created things / And the almighty source of cosmic change.

02.15_078:016 - There knowledge called him to her mystic peaks / Where thought is held in a vast internal sense / And feeling swims across a sea of peace / And vision climbs beyond the reach of Time.

02.15_078:017 - An equal of the first creator seers, / Accompanied by an all-revealing light / He moved through regions of transcendent Truth / Inward, immense, innumerably one.

02.15_078:018 - There distance was his own huge spirit’s extent; / Delivered from the fictions of the mind / Time’s triple dividing step baffled no more; / Its inevitable and continuous stream, / The long flow of its manifesting course, / Was held in spirit’s single wide regard.

02.15_078:019 - A universal beauty showed its face; / The invisible deep-fraught significances, / Here sheltered behind form’s insensible screen, / Uncovered to him their deathless harmony / And the key to the wonder-book of common things.

02.15_078:020 - In their uniting law stood up revealed / The multiple measures of the uplifting force, / The lines of the World-Geometer’s technique, / The enchantments that uphold the cosmic web / And the magic underlying simple shapes.

02.15_078:021 - On peaks where Silence listens with still heart / To the rhythmic metres of the rolling worlds, / He served the sessions of the triple fire.

02.15_078:022 - On the rim of two continents of slumber and trance / He heard the ever unspoken Reality’s voice / Awaken revelation’s mystic cry, / The birth-place found of the sudden infallible Word / And lived in the rays of an intuitive Sun.

02.15_078:023 - Absolved from the ligaments of death and sleep / He rode the lightning seas of cosmic Mind / And crossed the ocean of original sound; / On the last step to the supernal birth / He trod along extinction’s narrow edge / Near the high verges of eternity, / And mounted the gold ridge of the World-dream / Between the slayer and the saviour fires; / The belt he reached of the unchanging Truth, / Met borders of the inexpressible Light / And thrilled with the presence of the Ineffable.

02.15_078:024 - Above him he saw the flaming Hierarchies, / The wings that fold around created space, / The sun-eyed Guardians and the golden Sphinx / And the tiered planes and the immutable Lords.

02.15_078:025 - A wisdom waiting on Omniscience / Sat voiceless in a vast passivity; / It judged not, measured not, nor strove to know, / But listened for the all-seeing Thought / And the burden of a calm transcendent Voice.

02.15_078:026 - He had reached the top of all that can be known: / His sight surpassed creation’s head and base; / Ablaze the triple heavens revealed their suns, / The obscure Abyss exposed its monstrous rule.

02.15_078:027 - All but the ultimate Mystery was his field, / Almost the Unknowable disclosed its rim.

02.15_078:028 - His self’s infinities began to emerge, / The hidden universes cried to him; / Eternities called to eternities / Sending their speechless message still remote.

02.15_078:029 - Arisen from the marvel of the depths / And burning from the superconscious heights / And sweeping in great horizontal gyres / A million energies joined and were the One.

02.15_078:030 - All flowed immeasurably to one sea: / All living forms became its atom homes.

02.15_078:031 - A Panergy that harmonised all life / Held now existence in its vast control; / A portion of that majesty he was made.

02.15_078:032 - At will he lived in the unoblivious Ray.

02.15_078:033 - In that high realm where no untruth can come, / Where all are different and all is one, / In the Impersonal’s ocean without shore / The Person in the World-Spirit anchored rode; / It thrilled with the mighty marchings of World-Force, / Its acts were the comrades of God’s infinite peace.

02.15_078:034 - An adjunct glory and a symbol self, / The body was delivered to the soul,— / An immortal point of power, a block of poise / In a cosmicity’s wide formless surge, / A conscious edge of the Transcendent’s might / Carving perfection from a bright world-stuff, / It figured in it a universe’s sense.

02.15_078:035 - There consciousness was a close and single weft; / The far and near were one in spirit-space, / The moments there were pregnant with all time.

02.15_078:036 - The superconscient’s screen was ripped by thought, / Idea rotated symphonies of sight, / Sight was a flame-throw from identity; / Life was a marvellous journey of the spirit, / Feeling a wave from the universal Bliss.

02.15_078:037 - In the kingdom of the Spirit’s power and light, / As if one who arrived out of infinity’s womb / He came new-born, infant and limitless / And grew in the wisdom of the timeless Child; / He was a vast that soon became a Sun.

02.15_078:038 - A great luminous silence whispered to his heart; / His knowledge an inview caught unfathomable, / An outview by no brief horizons cut: / He thought and felt in all, his gaze had power.

02.15_078:039 - He communed with the Incommunicable; / Beings of a wider consciousness were his friends, / Forms of a larger subtler make drew near; / The Gods conversed with him behind Life’s veil.

02.15_078:040 - Neighbour his being grew to Nature’s crests.

02.15_078:041 - The primal Energy took him in its arms; / His brain was wrapped in overwhelming Light, / An all-embracing knowledge seized his heart: / Thoughts rose in him no earthly mind can hold, / Mights played that never coursed through mortal nerves: / He scanned the secrets of the Overmind, / He bore the rapture of the Oversoul.

02.15_078:042 - A borderer of the empire of the Sun, / Attuned to the supernal harmonies, / He linked creation to the Eternal’s sphere, / His finite parts approached their absolutes, / His actions framed the movements of the Gods, / His will took up the reins of cosmic Force.



Canto Book3 - 3: THE BOOK OF THE DIVINE MOTHER

Canto 1 - 3.1: The Pursuit of the Unknowable

Section I - 79


03.01_079:001 - All is too little that the world can give: / Its power and knowledge are the gifts of Time / And cannot fill the spirit’s sacred thirst.

03.01_079:002 - Although of One these forms of greatness are / And by its breath of grace our lives abide, / Although more near to us than nearness’ self, / It is some utter truth of what we are; / Hidden by its own works it seemed far off, / Impenetrable, occult, voiceless, obscure.

03.01_079:003 - The Presence was lost by which all things have charm, / The Glory lacked of which they are dim signs.

03.01_079:004 - The world lived on made empty of its Cause, / Like Love when the Beloved’s face is gone.

03.01_079:005 - The labour to know seemed a vain strife of Mind; / All knowledge ended in the Unknowable: / The effort to rule seemed a vain pride of Will; / A trivial achievement scorned by Time, / All power retired into the Omnipotent.

03.01_079:006 - A cave of darkness guards the eternal Light.

03.01_079:007 - A silence settled on his striving heart; / Absolved from the voices of the world’s desire, / He turned to the Ineffable’s timeless call.

03.01_079:008 - A Being intimate and unnameable, / A wide compelling ecstasy and peace / Felt in himself and all and yet ungrasped, / Approached and faded from his soul’s pursuit / As if for ever luring him beyond.

03.01_079:009 - Near, it retreated; far, it called him still.

03.01_079:010 - Nothing could satisfy but its delight: / Its absence left the greatest actions dull, / Its presence made the smallest seem divine.

03.01_079:011 - When it was there, the heart’s abyss was filled; / But when the uplifting Deity withdrew, / Existence lost its aim in the Inane.

03.01_079:012 - The order of the immemorial planes, / The godlike fullness of the instruments / Were turned to props for an impermanent scene.

03.01_079:013 - But who that mightiness was he knew not yet.

03.01_079:014 - Impalpable, yet filling all that is, / It made and blotted out a million worlds / And took and lost a thousand shapes and names.

03.01_079:015 - It wore the guise of an indiscernible Vast, / Or was a subtle kernel in the soul: / A distant greatness left it huge and dim, / A mystic closeness shut it sweetly in: / It seemed sometimes a figment or a robe / And seemed sometimes his own colossal shade.

03.01_079:016 - A giant doubt overshadowed his advance.

03.01_079:017 - Across a neutral all-supporting Void / Whose blankness nursed his lone immortal spirit, / Allured towards some recondite Supreme, / Aided, coerced by enigmatic Powers, / Aspiring and half-sinking and upborne, / Invincibly he ascended without pause.

03.01_079:018 - Always a signless vague Immensity / Brooded, without approach, beyond response, / Condemning finite things to nothingness, / Fronting him with the incommensurable.

03.01_079:019 - Then to the ascent there came a mighty term: / A height was reached where nothing made could live, / A line where every hope and search must cease / Neared some intolerant bare Reality, / A zero formed pregnant with boundless change.

03.01_079:020 - On a dizzy verge where all disguises fail / And human mind must abdicate in Light / Or die like a moth in the naked blaze of Truth, / He stood compelled to a tremendous choice.

03.01_079:021 - All he had been and all towards which he grew / Must now be left behind or else transform / Into a self of That which has no name.

03.01_079:022 - Alone and fronting an intangible Force / Which offered nothing to the grasp of Thought, / His spirit faced the adventure of the Inane.

03.01_079:023 - Abandoned by the worlds of form he strove.

03.01_079:024 - A fruitful world-wide Ignorance foundered there; / Thought’s long far-circling journey touched its close / And ineffective paused the actor Will.

03.01_079:025 - The symbol modes of being helped no more, / The structures Nescience builds collapsing failed, / And even the spirit that holds the universe / Fainted in luminous insufficiency.

03.01_079:026 - In an abysmal lapse of all things built / Transcending every perishable support / And joining at last its mighty origin, / The separate self must melt or be reborn / Into a Truth beyond the mind’s appeal.

03.01_079:027 - All glory of outline, sweetness of harmony, / Rejected like a grace of trivial notes, / Expunged from Being’s silence nude, austere, / Died into a fine and blissful Nothingness.

03.01_079:028 - The Demiurges lost their names and forms, / The great schemed worlds that they had planned and wrought / Passed, taken and abolished one by one.

03.01_079:029 - The universe removed its coloured veil, / And at the unimaginable end / Of the huge riddle of created things / Appeared the far-seen Godhead of the whole, / His feet firm-based on Life’s stupendous wings, / Omnipotent or lonely seer of Time, / Inward, inscrutable, with diamond gaze.

03.01_079:030 - Attracted by the unfathomable regard / The unsolved slow cycles to their fount returned / To rise again from that invisible sea.

03.01_079:031 - All from his puissance born was now undone; / Nothing remained the cosmic Mind conceives.

03.01_079:032 - Eternity prepared to fade and seemed / A hue and imposition on the Void, / Space was the fluttering of a dream that sank / Before its ending into Nothing’s deeps.

03.01_079:033 - The spirit that dies not and the Godhead’s self / Seemed myths projected from the Unknowable; / From It all sprang, in It is called to cease.

03.01_079:034 - But what That was, no thought or sight could tell.

03.01_079:035 - Only a formless Form of self was left, / A tenuous ghost of something that had been, / The last experience of a lapsing wave / Before it sinks into a bourneless sea,— / As if it kept even on the brink of Nought / Its bare feeling of the ocean whence it came.

03.01_079:036 - A Vastness brooded free from sense of Space, / An Everlastingness cut off from Time; / A strange sublime unalterable Peace / Silent rejected from it world and soul.

03.01_079:037 - A stark companionless Reality / Answered at last to his soul’s passionate search: / Passionless, wordless, absorbed in fathomless peace, / Keeping the mystery none would ever pierce, / It brooded inscrutable and intangible / Facing him with its dumb tremendous calm.

03.01_079:038 - It had no kinship with the universe: / There was no act, no movement in its Vast: / Life’s question met by its silence died on her lips, / The world’s effort ceased convicted of ignorance / Finding no sanction of supernal Light: / There was no mind there with its need to know, / There was no heart there with its need to love.

03.01_079:039 - All person perished in its namelessness.

03.01_079:040 - There was no second, it had no partner or peer; / Only itself was real to itself.

03.01_079:041 - A pure existence safe from thought and mood, / A consciousness of unshared immortal bliss, / It dwelt aloof in its bare infinite, / One and unique, unutterably sole.

03.01_079:042 - A Being formless, featureless and mute / That knew itself by its own timeless self, / Aware for ever in its motionless depths, / Uncreating, uncreated and unborn, / The One by whom all live, who lives by none, / An immeasurable luminous secrecy / Guarded by the veils of the Unmanifest, / Above the changing cosmic interlude / Abode supreme, immutably the same, / A silent Cause occult, impenetrable,— / Infinite, eternal, unthinkable, alone.


Canto 2 - 3.2: The Adoration of the Divine Mother

Section I - 80: glad divine abyss


03.02_080:001 - A stillness absolute, incommunicable, / Meets the sheer self-discovery of the soul; / A wall of stillness shuts it from the world, / A gulf of stillness swallows up the sense / And makes unreal all that mind has known, / All that the labouring senses still would weave / Prolonging an imaged unreality.

03.02_080:002 - Self’s vast spiritual silence occupies space; / Only the Inconceivable is left, / Only the Nameless without space and time: / Abolished is the burdening need of life: / Thought falls from us, we cease from joy and grief; / The ego is dead; we are free from being and care, / We have done with birth and death and work and fate.

03.02_080:003 - O soul, it is too early to rejoice!

03.02_080:004 - Thou hast reached the boundless silence of the Self, / Thou hast leaped into a glad divine abyss; / But where hast thou thrown self’s mission and self’s power?

03.02_080:005 - On what dead bank on the Eternal’s road?

03.02_080:006 - One was within thee who was self and world, / What hast thou done for his purpose in the stars?

03.02_080:007 - Escape brings not the victory and the crown!

03.02_080:008 - Something thou cam’st to do from the Unknown, / But nothing is finished and the world goes on, / Because only half God’s cosmic work is done.

03.02_080:009 - Only the everlasting No has neared / And stared into thy eyes and killed thy heart: / But where is the Lover’s everlasting Yes, / And immortality in the secret heart, / The voice that chants to the creator Fire, / The symboled OM, the great assenting Word, / The bridge between the rapture and the calm, / The passion and the beauty of the Bride, / The chamber where the glorious enemies kiss, / The smile that saves, the golden peak of things?

03.02_080:010 - This too is Truth at the mystic fount of Life.

03.02_080:011 - A black veil has been lifted; we have seen / The mighty shadow of the omniscient Lord; / But who has lifted up the veil of light / And who has seen the body of the King?

03.02_080:012 - The mystery of God’s birth and acts remains / Leaving unbroken the last chapter’s seal, / Unsolved the riddle of the unfinished Play; / The cosmic Player laughs within his mask, / And still the last inviolate secret hides / Behind the human glory of a Form, / Behind the gold eidolon of a Name.

03.02_080:013 - A large white line has figured as a goal, / But far beyond the ineffable suntracks blaze.

03.02_080:014 - What seemed the source and end was a wide gate, / A last bare step into eternity.

03.02_080:015 - An eye has opened upon timelessness, / Infinity takes back the forms it gave, / And through God’s darkness or his naked light / His million rays return into the Sun.

03.02_080:016 - There is a zero sign of the Supreme; / Nature left nude and still uncovers God.

03.02_080:017 - But in her grandiose nothingness all is there: / When her strong garbs are torn away from us, / The soul’s ignorance is slain but not the soul.

03.02_080:018 - The zero covers an immortal face.

03.02_080:019 - A high and black negation is not all, / A huge extinction is not God’s last word, / Life’s ultimate sense, the close of being’s course, / The meaning of this great mysterious world.

03.02_080:020 - In absolute silence sleeps an absolute Power.

03.02_080:021 - Awaking, it can wake the trance-bound soul / And in the ray reveal the parent sun: / It can make the world a vessel of Spirit’s force, / It can fashion in the clay God’s perfect shape.

03.02_080:022 - To free the self is but one radiant pace; / Here to fulfil himself was God’s desire.


Section I - 81: someone came Infinite


03.02_081:001 - Even while he stood on being’s naked edge / And all the passion and seeking of his soul / Faced their extinction in some featureless Vast, / The Presence he yearned for suddenly drew close.

03.02_081:002 - Across the silence of the ultimate Calm, / Out of a marvellous Transcendence’ core, / A body of wonder and translucency / As if a sweet mystic summary of her self, / Escaping into the original Bliss / Had come enlarged out of eternity, / Someone came infinite and absolute.

03.02_081:003 - A being of wisdom, power and delight, / Even as a mother draws her child to her arms, / Took to her breast Nature and world and soul.

03.02_081:004 - Abolishing the signless emptiness, / Breaking the vacancy and voiceless hush, / Piercing the limitless Unknowable, / Into the liberty of the motionless depths / A beautiful and felicitous lustre stole, / Imaged itself in a surprising beam / And built a golden passage to his heart / Touching through him all longing sentient things.

03.02_081:005 - A moment’s sweetness of the All-Beautiful / Cancelled the vanity of the cosmic whirl.

03.02_081:006 - A Nature throbbing with a Heart divine / Was felt in the unconscious universe; / It made the breath a happy mystery / And brought a love sustaining pain with joy; / A love that bore the cross of pain with joy, / Eudaemonised the sorrow of the world, / Made happy the weight of long unending Time, / The secret caught of God’s felicity.

03.02_081:007 - Affirming in life a hidden ecstasy / It held the spirit to its miraculous course; / Carrying immortal values to the hours / It justified the labour of the suns.

03.02_081:008 - For one was there supreme behind the God.

03.02_081:009 - A Mother Might brooded upon the world; / A Consciousness revealed its marvellous front / Transcending all that is, denying none: / Imperishable above our fallen heads / He felt a rapturous and unstumbling Force.

03.02_081:010 - The undying Truth appeared, the enduring Power / Of all that here is made and then destroyed, / The Mother of all godheads and all strengths / Who, mediatrix, binds earth to the Supreme.

03.02_081:011 - The Enigma ceased that rules our nature’s night, / The covering Nescience was unmasked and slain; / Its mind of error was stripped off from things / And the dull moods of its perverting will.

03.02_081:012 - Illumined by her all-seeing identity / Knowledge and Ignorance could strive no more; / No longer could the titan Opposites, / Antagonist poles of the world’s artifice, / Impose the illusion of their twofold screen / Throwing their figures between us and her.

03.02_081:013 - The Wisdom was near, disguised by its own works, / Of which the darkened universe is the robe.

03.02_081:014 - No more existence seemed an aimless fall, / Extinction was no more the sole release.

03.02_081:015 - The hidden Word was found, the long-sought clue, / Revealed was the meaning of our spirit’s birth, / Condemned to an imperfect body and mind, / In the inconscience of material things / And the indignity of mortal life.

03.02_081:016 - A Heart was felt in the spaces wide and bare, / A burning Love from white spiritual founts / Annulled the sorrow of the ignorant depths; / Suffering was lost in her immortal smile.

03.02_081:017 - A Life from beyond grew conqueror here of Death; / To err no more was natural to mind; / Wrong could not come where all was light and love.

03.02_081:018 - The Formless and the Formed were joined in her.

03.02_081:019 - Immensity was exceeded by a look, / A Face revealed the crowded Infinite.

03.02_081:020 - Incarnating inexpressibly in her limbs / The boundless joy the blind world-forces seek, / Her body of beauty mooned the seas of bliss.

03.02_081:021 - At the head she stands of birth and toil and fate, / In their slow round the cycles turn to her call; / Alone her hands can change Time’s dragon base.

03.02_081:022 - Hers is the mystery the Night conceals; / The spirit’s alchemist energy is hers; / She is the golden bridge, the wonderful fire.

03.02_081:023 - The luminous heart of the Unknown is she, / A power of silence in the depths of God; / She is the Force, the inevitable Word, / The magnet of our difficult ascent, / The Sun from which we kindle all our suns, / The Light that leans from the unrealised Vasts, / The joy that beckons from the impossible, / The Might of all that never yet came down.

03.02_081:024 - All Nature dumbly calls to her alone / To heal with her feet the aching throb of life / And break the seals on the dim soul of man / And kindle her fire in the closed heart of things.

03.02_081:025 - All here shall be one day her sweetness’s home, / All contraries prepare her harmony; / Towards her our knowledge climbs, our passion gropes, / In her miraculous rapture we shall dwell, / Her clasp will turn to ecstasy our pain.

03.02_081:026 - Our self shall be one self with all through her.

03.02_081:027 - In her confirmed because transformed in her, / Our life shall find in its fulfilled response / Above, the boundless hushed beatitudes, / Below, the wonder of the embrace divine.

03.02_081:028 - This known as in a thunder-flash of God, / The rapture of things eternal filled his limbs; / Amazement fell upon his ravished sense; / His spirit was caught in her intolerant flame.

03.02_081:029 - Once seen, his heart acknowledged only her.

03.02_081:030 - Only a hunger of infinite bliss was left.

03.02_081:031C - All aims in her were lost, then found in her; / His base was gathered into one pointing spire.


Section I - 82: ask for earth and men


03.02_082:001 - Thus was a seed cast into endless Time.

03.02_082:002 - A Word is spoken or a Light is shown, / A moment sees, the ages toil to express.

03.02_082:003 - So flashing out of the Timeless leaped the worlds; / An eternal instant is the cause of the years.

03.02_082:004 - All he had done was to prepare a field; / His small beginnings asked for a mighty end: / For all that he had been must now new-shape / In him her joy to embody, to enshrine / Her beauty and greatness in his house of life.

03.02_082:005 - But now his being was too wide for self; / His heart’s demand had grown immeasurable: / His single freedom could not satisfy, / Her light, her bliss he asked for earth and men.

03.02_082:006 - But vain are human power and human love / To break earth’s seal of ignorance and death; / His nature’s might seemed now an infant’s grasp; / Heaven is too high for outstretched hands to seize.

03.02_082:007 - This Light comes not by struggle or by thought; / In the mind’s silence the Transcendent acts / And the hushed heart hears the unuttered Word.

03.02_082:008 - A vast surrender was his only strength.

03.02_082:009 - A Power that lives upon the heights must act, / Bring into life’s closed room the Immortal’s air / And fill the finite with the Infinite.

03.02_082:010t - All that denies must be torn out and slain / And crushed the many longings for whose sake / We lose the One for whom our lives were made. #conditions-of-realization #cost-of-smallness #spiritual-instruction #spiritual-needs #yoga

03.02_082:011 - Now other claims had hushed in him their cry: / Only he longed to draw her presence and power / Into his heart and mind and breathing frame; / Only he yearned to call for ever down / Her healing touch of love and truth and joy / Into the darkness of the suffering world.

03.02_082:012 - His soul was freed and given to her alone.


Canto 3 - 3.3: The House of the Spirit and the New Creation

Section I - 83: all that denies


03.03_083:001 - A mightier task remained than all he had done.

03.03_083:002 - To that he turned from which all being comes, / A sign attending from the Secrecy / Which knows the Truth ungrasped behind our thoughts / And guards the world with its all-seeing gaze.

03.03_083:003 - In the unapproachable stillness of his soul, / Intense, one-pointed, monumental, lone / Patient he sat like an incarnate hope / Motionless on a pedestal of prayer.

03.03_083:004 - A Strength he sought that was not yet on earth, / Help from a Power too great for mortal will, / The Light of a Truth now only seen afar, / A sanction from his high omnipotent Source.

03.03_083:005 - But from the appalling heights there stooped no voice; / The timeless lids were closed; no opening came.

03.03_083:006 - A neutral helpless void oppressed the years.

03.03_083:007 - In the texture of our bound humanity / He felt the stark resistance huge and dumb / Of our inconscient and unseeing base, / The stubborn mute rejection in Life’s depths, / The ignorant No in the origin of things.

03.03_083:008 - A veiled collaboration with the Night / Even in himself survived and hid from his view: / Still something in his earthly being kept / Its kinship with the Inconscient whence it came.

03.03_083:009 - A shadowy unity with a vanished past / Treasured in an old world-frame was lurking there, / Secret, unnoted by the illumined mind, / And in subconscious whispers and in dream / Still murmured at the mind’s and spirit’s choice.

03.03_083:010 - Its treacherous elements spread like slippery grains / Hoping the incoming Truth might stumble and fall, / And old ideal voices wandering moaned / And pleaded for a heavenly leniency / To the gracious imperfections of our earth / And the sweet weaknesses of our mortal state.

03.03_083:011 - This now he willed to discover and exile, / The element in him betraying God.

03.03_083:012 - All Nature’s recondite spaces were stripped bare, / All her dim crypts and corners searched with fire / Where refugee instincts and unshaped revolts / Could shelter find in darkness’ sanctuary / Against the white purity of heaven’s cleansing flame.

03.03_083:013 - All seemed to have perished that was undivine: / Yet some minutest dissident might escape / And still a centre lurk of the blind force.

03.03_083:014 - For the Inconscient too is infinite; / The more its abysses we insist to sound, / The more it stretches, stretches endlessly.

03.03_083:015 - Then lest a human cry should spoil the Truth / He tore desire up from its bleeding roots / And offered to the gods the vacant place.

03.03_083:016 - Thus could he bear the touch immaculate.

03.03_083:017 - A last and mightiest transformation came.

03.03_083:018 - His soul was all in front like a great sea / Flooding the mind and body with its waves; / His being, spread to embrace the universe, / United the within and the without / To make of life a cosmic harmony, / An empire of the immanent Divine.

03.03_083:019 - In this tremendous universality / Not only his soul-nature and mind-sense / Included every soul and mind in his, / But even the life of flesh and nerve was changed / And grew one flesh and nerve with all that lives; / He felt the joy of others as his joy, / He bore the grief of others as his grief; / His universal sympathy upbore, / Immense like ocean, the creation’s load / As earth upbears all beings’ sacrifice, / Thrilled with the hidden Transcendent’s joy and peace.

03.03_083:020 - There was no more division’s endless scroll; / One grew the Spirit’s secret unity, / All nature felt again the single bliss; / There was no cleavage between soul and soul, / There was no barrier between world and God.

03.03_083:021 - Overpowered were form and memory’s limiting line; / The covering mind was seized and torn apart; / It was dissolved and now no more could be, / The one Consciousness that made the world was seen; / All now was luminosity and force.

03.03_083:022 - Abolished in its last thin fainting trace / The circle of the little self was gone; / The separate being could no more be felt; / It disappeared and knew itself no more, / Lost in the Spirit’s wide identity.

03.03_083:023 - His nature grew a movement of the All, / Exploring itself to find that all was He, / His soul was a delegation of the All / That turned from itself to join the one Supreme.

03.03_083:024 - Transcended was the human formula; / Man’s heart that had obscured the Inviolable / Assumed the mighty beating of a god’s; / His seeking mind ceased in the Truth that knows; / His life was a flow of the universal life.

03.03_083:025 - He stood fulfilled on the world’s highest line / Awaiting the ascent beyond the world, / Awaiting the Descent the world to save.

03.03_083:026 - A Splendour and a Symbol wrapped the earth, / Serene epiphanies looked and hallowed vasts / Surrounded, wise infinitudes were close / And bright remotenesses leaned near and kin.

03.03_083:027 - Sense failed in that tremendous lucency; / Ephemeral voices from his hearing fell / And Thought potent no more sank large and pale / Like a tired god into mysterious seas.

03.03_083:028 - The robes of mortal thinking were cast down / Leaving his knowledge bare to absolute sight; / Fate’s driving ceased and Nature’s sleepless spur: / The athlete heavings of the will were stilled / In the Omnipotent’s unmoving peace.

03.03_083:029 - Life in his members lay down vast and mute; / Naked, unwalled, unterrified it bore / The immense regard of Immortality.

03.03_083:030 - The last movement died and all at once grew still.

03.03_083:031 - A weight that was the unseen Transcendent’s hand / Laid on his limbs the spirit’s measureless seal, / Infinity swallowed him into shoreless trance.


Section I - 84: sorrowless heights


03.03_084:001 - As one who sets his sail towards mysteried shores / Driven through huge oceans by the breath of God, / The fathomless below, the unknown around, / His soul abandoned the blind star-field, Space.

03.03_084:002 - Afar from all that makes the measured world, / Plunging to hidden eternities it withdrew / Back from mind’s foaming surface to the Vasts / Voiceless within us in omniscient sleep.

03.03_084:003 - Above the imperfect reach of word and thought, / Beyond the sight, the last support of form, / Lost in deep tracts of superconscient Light, / Or voyaging in blank featureless Nothingness, / Sole in the trackless Incommensurable, / Or past not-self and self and selflessness, / Transgressing the dream-shores of conscious mind / He reached at last his sempiternal base.

03.03_084:004 - On sorrowless heights no winging cry disturbs, / Pure and untouched above the mortal play / Is spread the spirit’s hushed immobile air.

03.03_084:005 - There no beginning is and there no end; / There is the stable force of all that moves; / There the aeonic labourer is at rest.

03.03_084:006 - There turns no keyed creation in the void, / No giant mechanism watched by a soul; / There creaks no fate-turned huge machinery; / The marriage of evil with good within one breast, / The clash of strife in the very clasp of love, / The dangerous pain of life’s experiment / In the values of Inconsequence and Chance, / The peril of mind’s gamble, throwing our lives / As stake in a wager of indifferent gods / And the shifting lights and shadows of the idea / Falling upon the surface consciousness, / And in the dream of a mute witness soul / Creating the error of a half-seen world / Where knowledge is a seeking ignorance, / Life’s steps a stumbling series without suit, / Its aspect of fortuitous design, / Its equal measure of the true and false / In that immobile and immutable realm / Find no access, no cause, no right to live: / There only reigns the Spirit’s motionless power / Poised in itself through still eternity / And its omniscient and omnipotent peace.

03.03_084:007 - Thought clashes not with thought and truth with truth, / There is no war of right with rival right; / There are no stumbling and half-seeing lives / Passing from chance to unexpected chance, / No suffering of hearts compelled to beat / In bodies of the inert Inconscient’s make.

03.03_084:008 - Armed with the immune occult unsinking Fire / The guardians of Eternity keep its law / For ever fixed upon Truth’s giant base / In her magnificent and termless home.

03.03_084:009 - There Nature on her dumb spiritual couch / Immutably transcendent knows her source / And to the stir of multitudinous worlds / Assents unmoved in a perpetual calm.

03.03_084:010 - All-causing, all-sustaining and aloof, / The Witness looks from his unshaken poise, / An Eye immense regarding all things done.

03.03_084:011 - Apart, at peace above creation’s stir, / Immersed in the eternal altitudes, / He abode defended in his shoreless self, / Companioned only by the all-seeing One.

03.03_084:012 - A Mind too mighty to be bound by Thought, / A Life too boundless for the play in space, / A Soul without borders unconvinced of Time, / He felt the extinction of the world’s long pain, / He became the unborn Self that never dies, / He joined the sessions of Infinity.

03.03_084:013 - On the cosmic murmur primal loneliness fell, / Annulled was the contact formed with time-born things, / Empty grew Nature’s wide community.

03.03_084:014 - All things were brought back to their formless seed, / The world was silent for a cyclic hour.

03.03_084:015 - Although the afflicted Nature he has left / Maintained beneath him her broad numberless fields, / Her enormous act, receding, failed remote / As if a soulless dream at last had ceased.

03.03_084:016 - No voice came down from the high silences, / None answered from her desolate solitudes.

03.03_084:017 - A stillness of cessation reigned, the wide / Immortal hush before the gods were born; / A universal Force awaited, mute, / The veiled Transcendent’s ultimate decree.


Section I - 85: white vasts


03.03_085:001 - Then suddenly there came a downward look / As if a sea exploring its own depths; / A living Oneness widened at its core / And joined him to unnumbered multitudes.

03.03_085:002 - A Bliss, a Light, a Power, a flame-white Love / Caught all into a sole immense embrace; / Existence found its truth on Oneness’ breast / And each became the self and space of all.

03.03_085:003 - The great world-rhythms were heart-beats of one Soul, / To feel was a flame-discovery of God, / All mind was a single harp of many strings, / All life a song of many meeting lives; / For worlds were many, but the Self was one.

03.03_085:004 - This knowledge was now made a cosmos’ seed: / This seed was cased in the safety of the Light, / It needed not a sheath of Ignorance.

03.03_085:005 - Then from the trance of that tremendous clasp / And from the throbbings of that single Heart / And from the naked Spirit’s victory / A new and marvellous creation rose.

03.03_085:006 - Incalculable outflowing infinitudes / Laughing out an unmeasured happiness / Lived their innumerable unity; / Worlds where the being is unbound and wide / Bodied unthinkably the egoless Self, / Rapture of beatific energies / Joined Time to the Timeless, poles of a single joy; / White vasts were seen where all is wrapped in all.

03.03_085:007 - There were no contraries, no sundered parts, / All by spiritual links were joined to all / And bound indissolubly to the One: / Each was unique but took all lives as its own, / And, following out these tones of the Infinite, / Recognised in himself the universe.

03.03_085:008 - A splendid centre of infinity’s whirl / Pushed to its zenith’s height, its last expanse, / Felt the divinity of its own self-bliss / Repeated in its numberless other selves.

03.03_085:009 - It took up tirelessly into its scope / Persons and figures of the Impersonal, / As if prolonging in a celestial count, / In a rapturous multiplication’s sum, / The recurring decimals of eternity.

03.03_085:010 - None was apart, none lived for himself alone, / Each lived for God in him and God in all, / Each soleness inexpressibly held the whole.

03.03_085:011 - There Oneness was not tied to monotone; / It showed a thousand aspects of itself, / Its luminous immutable stability / Upbore on a changeless ground for ever safe, / Compelled to a spontaneous servitude, / The ever-changing incalculable steps, / The seeming-reckless dance’s subtle plan / Of immense world-forces in their perfect play.

03.03_085:012 - Appearance looked back to its hidden truth / And made of difference oneness’ smiling play; / It made all persons fractions of the Unique, / Yet all were being’s secret integers.

03.03_085:013 - All struggle was turned to a sweet strife of love / In the harmonised circle of a sure embrace.

03.03_085:014 - Identity’s reconciling happiness gave / A rich security to difference.

03.03_085:015 - On a meeting line of hazardous extremes / The Game of games was played to its breaking point, / Where through self-finding by divine self-loss / There leaps out unity’s supreme delight / Whose blissful undivided sweetness feels / A commonalty of the Absolute.

03.03_085:016 - There was no sob of suffering anywhere; / Experience ran from point to point of joy: / Bliss was the pure undying truth of things.

03.03_085:017 - All Nature was a conscious front of God: / A wisdom worked in all, self-moved, self-sure, / A plenitude of illimitable Light, / An authenticity of intuitive Truth, / A glory and passion of creative Force.

03.03_085:018 - Infallible, leaping from eternity, / The moment’s thought inspired the passing act, / A word, a laughter sprang from Silence’ breast, / A rhythm of Beauty in the calm of Space, / A Knowledge in the fathomless heart of Time.

03.03_085:019 - All turned to all without reserve’s recoil: / A single ecstasy without a break, / Love was a close and thrilled identity / In the throbbing heart of all that luminous life.

03.03_085:020 - A universal vision that unites, / A sympathy of nerve replying to nerve, / Hearing that listens to thought’s inner sound / And follows the rhythmic meanings of the heart, / A touch that needs not hands to feel, to clasp, / Were there the native means of consciousness / And heightened the intimacy of soul with soul.

03.03_085:021 - A grand orchestra of spiritual powers, / A diapason of soul interchange / Harmonised a oneness deep, immeasurable.

03.03_085:022 - In these new worlds projected he became / A portion of the universal gaze, / A station of the all-inhabiting light, / A ripple on a single sea of peace.

03.03_085:023 - His mind answered to countless communing minds, / His words were syllables of the cosmos’ speech, / His life a field of the vast cosmic stir.

03.03_085:024 - He felt the footsteps of a million wills / Moving in unison to a single goal.

03.03_085:025 - A stream ever new-born that never dies, / Caught in its thousandfold current’s ravishing flow, / With its eddies of immortal sweetness thrilled, / He bore coiling through his members as they passed / Calm movements of interminable delight, / The bliss of a myriad myriads who are one.


Section I - 86: temple of the ideal


03.03_086:001 - In this vast outbreak of perfection’s law / Imposing its fixity on the flux of things / He saw a hierarchy of lucent planes / Enfeoffed to this highest kingdom of God-state.

03.03_086:002 - Attuning to one Truth their own right rule / Each housed the gladness of a bright degree, / Alone in beauty, perfect in self-kind, / An image cast by one deep truth’s absolute, / Married to all in happy difference.

03.03_086:003 - Each gave its powers to help its neighbours’ parts, / But suffered no diminution by the gift; / Profiteers of a mystic interchange, / They grew by what they took and what they gave, / All others they felt as their own complements, / One in the might and joy of multitude.

03.03_086:004 - Even in the poise where Oneness draws apart / To feel the rapture of its separate selves, / The Sole in its solitude yearned towards the All / And the Many turned to look back at the One.

03.03_086:005 - An all-revealing all-creating Bliss, / Seeking for forms to manifest truths divine, / Aligned in their significant mystery / The gleams of the symbols of the Ineffable / Blazoned like hues upon a colourless air / On the white purity of the Witness Soul.

03.03_086:006 - These hues were the very prism of the Supreme, / His beauty, power, delight creation’s cause.

03.03_086:007 - A vast Truth-Consciousness took up these signs / To pass them on to some divine child Heart / That looked on them with laughter and delight / And joyed in these transcendent images / Living and real as the truths they house.

03.03_086:008 - The Spirit’s white neutrality became / A playground of miracles, a rendezvous / For the secret powers of a mystic Timelessness: / It made of space a marvel house of God, / It poured through Time its works of ageless might, / Unveiled seen as a luring rapturous face / The wonder and beauty of its Love and Force.

03.03_086:009 - The eternal Goddess moved in her cosmic house / Sporting with God as a Mother with her child: / To him the universe was her bosom of love, / His toys were the immortal verities.

03.03_086:010 - All here self-lost had there its divine place.

03.03_086:011 - The Powers that here betray our hearts and err, / Were there sovereign in truth, perfect in joy, / Masters in a creation without flaw, / Possessors of their own infinitude.

03.03_086:012 - There Mind, a splendid sun of vision’s rays, / Shaped substance by the glory of its thoughts / And moved amidst the grandeur of its dreams.

03.03_086:013 - Imagination’s great ensorcelling rod / Summoned the unknown and gave to it a home, / Outspread luxuriantly in golden air / Truth’s iris-coloured wings of fantasy, / Or sang to the intuitive heart of joy / Wonder’s dream-notes that bring the Real close.

03.03_086:014 - Its Power that makes the unknowable near and true, / In the temple of the ideal shrined the One: / It peopled thought and mind and happy sense / Filled with bright aspects of the might of God / And living persons of the one Supreme, / The speech that voices the ineffable, / The ray revealing unseen Presences, / The virgin forms through which the Formless shines, / The Word that ushers divine experience / And the Ideas that crowd the Infinite.

03.03_086:015 - There was no gulf between the thought and fact; / Ever they replied like bird to calling bird; / The will obeyed the thought, the act the will, / There was a harmony woven twixt soul and soul.

03.03_086:016 - A marriage with eternity divinised Time.

03.03_086:017 - There Life pursued unwearied of her sport, / Joy in her heart and laughter on her lips, / The bright adventure of God’s game of chance.

03.03_086:018 - In her ingenious ardour of caprice, / In her transfiguring mirth she mapped on Time / A fascinating puzzle of events, / Lured at each turn by new vicissitudes / To self-discovery that could never cease.

03.03_086:019 - Ever she framed stark bonds for the will to break, / Brought new creations for the thought’s surprise / And passionate ventures for the heart to dare, / Where Truth recurred with an unexpected face / Or else repeated old familiar joy / Like the return of a delightful rhyme.

03.03_086:020 - At hide and seek on a Mother-Wisdom’s breast, / An artist teeming with her world-idea, / She never could exhaust its numberless thoughts / And vast adventure into thinking shapes / And trial and lure of a new living’s dreams.

03.03_086:021 - Untired of sameness and untired of change, / Endlessly she unrolled her moving act, / A mystery drama of divine delight, / A living poem of world ecstasy, / A kakemono of significant forms, / A coiled perspective of developing scenes, / A brilliant chase of self-revealing shapes, / An ardent hunt of soul looking for soul, / A seeking and a finding as of gods.

03.03_086:022 - There Matter is the Spirit’s firm density, / An artistry of glad outwardness of self, / A treasure-house of lasting images / Where sense can build a world of pure delight: / The home of a perpetual happiness, / It lodged the hours as in a pleasant inn.

03.03_086:023 - The senses there were outlets of the soul; / Even the youngest child-thought of the mind / Incarnated some touch of highest things.

03.03_086:024 - There substance was a resonant harp of self, / A net for the constant lightnings of the Spirit, / A magnet power of love’s intensity / Whose yearning throb and adoration’s cry / Drew God’s approaches close, sweet, wonderful.

03.03_086:025 - Its solidity was a mass of heavenly make; / Its fixity and sweet permanence of charm / Made a bright pedestal for felicity.

03.03_086:026 - Its bodies woven by a divine sense / Prolonged the nearness of soul’s clasp with soul; / Its warm play of external sight and touch / Reflected the glow and thrill of the heart’s joy, / Mind’s climbing brilliant thoughts, the spirit’s bliss; / Life’s rapture kept for ever its flame and cry.

03.03_086:027 - All that now passes lived immortal there / In the proud beauty and fine harmony / Of Matter plastic to spiritual light.

03.03_086:028 - Its ordered hours proclaimed the eternal Law; / Vision reposed on a safety of deathless forms; / Time was Eternity’s transparent robe.

03.03_086:029 - An architect hewing out self’s living rock, / Phenomenon built Reality’s summer-house / On the beaches of the sea of Infinity.



Section I - 87: all seemed a vainly


03.03_087:001 - Against this glory of spiritual states, / Their parallels and yet their opposites / Floated and swayed, eclipsed and shadow-like / As if a doubt made substance, flickering, pale, / This other scheme two vast negations found.

03.03_087:002 - A world that knows not its inhabiting Self, / Labours to find its cause and need to be; / A spirit ignorant of the world it made, / Obscured by Matter, travestied by Life, / Struggles to emerge, to be free, to know and reign; / These were close-tied in one disharmony, / Yet the divergent lines met not at all.

03.03_087:003 - Three Powers governed its irrational course, / In the beginning an unknowing Force, / In the middle an embodied striving soul, / In its end a silent spirit denying life.

03.03_087:004 - A dull and infelicitous interlude / Unrolls its dubious truth to a questioning Mind / Compelled by the ignorant Power to play its part / And to record her inconclusive tale, / The mystery of her inconscient plan / And the riddle of a being born from Night / By a marriage of Necessity with Chance.

03.03_087:005 - This darkness hides our nobler destiny.

03.03_087:006 - A chrysalis of a great and glorious truth, / It stifles the winged marvel in its sheath / Lest from the prison of Matter it escape / And, wasting its beauty on the formless Vast, / Merged into the Unknowable’s mystery, / Leave unfulfilled the world’s miraculous fate.

03.03_087:007 - As yet thought only some high spirit’s dream / Or a vexed illusion in man’s toiling mind, / A new creation from the old shall rise, / A Knowledge inarticulate find speech, / Beauty suppressed burst into paradise bloom, / Pleasure and pain dive into absolute bliss.

03.03_087:008 - A tongueless oracle shall speak at last, / The Superconscient conscious grow on earth, / The Eternal’s wonders join the dance of Time.

03.03_087:009 - But now all seemed a vainly teeming vast / Upheld by a deluded Energy / To a spectator self-absorbed and mute, / Careless of the unmeaning show he watched, / Regarding the bizarre procession pass / Like one who waits for an expected end.

03.03_087:010 - He saw a world that is from a world to be.

03.03_087:011 - There he divined rather than saw or felt, / Far off upon the rim of consciousness, / Transient and frail this little whirling globe / And on it left like a lost dream’s vain mould, / A fragile copy of the spirit’s shell, / His body gathered into mystic sleep.

03.03_087:012 - A foreign shape it seemed, a mythic shade.



Section I - 88: ransome of the night


03.03_088:001 - Alien now seemed that dim far universe, / Self and eternity alone were true.

03.03_088:002 - Then memory climbed to him from the striving planes / Bringing a cry from once-loved cherished things, / And to the cry as to its own lost call / A ray replied from the occult Supreme.

03.03_088:003 - For even there the boundless Oneness dwells.

03.03_088:004 - To its own sight unrecognisable, / It lived still sunk in its own tenebrous seas, / Upholding the world’s inconscient unity / Hidden in Matter’s insentient multitude.

03.03_088:005 - This seed-self sown in the Indeterminate / Forfeits its glory of divinity, / Concealing the omnipotence of its Force, / Concealing the omniscience of its Soul; / An agent of its own transcendent Will, / It merges knowledge in the inconscient deep; / Accepting error, sorrow, death and pain, / It pays the ransom of the ignorant Night, / Redeeming by its substance Nature’s fall.

03.03_088:006 - Himself he knew and why his soul had gone / Into earth’s passionate obscurity / To share the labour of an errant Power / Which by division hopes to find the One.

03.03_088:007 - Two beings he was, one wide and free above, / One struggling, bound, intense, its portion here.

03.03_088:008 - A tie between them still could bridge two worlds; / There was a dim response, a distant breath; / All had not ceased in the unbounded hush.

03.03_088:009 - His heart lay somewhere conscious and alone / Far down below him like a lamp in night; / Abandoned it lay, alone, imperishable, / Immobile with excess of passionate will, / His living, sacrificed and offered heart / Absorbed in adoration mystical, / Turned to its far-off fount of light and love.

03.03_088:010 - In the luminous stillness of its mute appeal / It looked up to the heights it could not see; / It yearned from the longing depths it could not leave.

03.03_088:011 - In the centre of its vast and fateful trance / Half way between his free and fallen selves, / Interceding twixt God’s day and the mortal’s night, / Accepting worship as its single law, / Accepting bliss as the sole cause of things, / Refusing the austere joy which none can share, / Refusing the calm that lives for calm alone, / To her it turned for whom it willed to be.

03.03_088:012 - In the passion of its solitary dream / It lay like a closed soundless oratory / Where sleeps a consecrated argent floor / Lit by a single and untrembling ray / And an invisible Presence kneels in prayer.

03.03_088:013 - On some deep breast of liberating peace / All else was satisfied with quietude; / This only knew there was a truth beyond.

03.03_088:014 - All other parts were dumb in centred sleep / Consenting to the slow deliberate Power / Which tolerates the world’s error and its grief, / Consenting to the cosmic long delay, / Timelessly waiting through the patient years / Her coming they had asked for earth and men; / This was the fiery point that called her now.

03.03_088:015 - Extinction could not quench that lonely fire; / Its seeing filled the blank of mind and will; / Thought dead, its changeless force abode and grew.

03.03_088:016 - Armed with the intuition of a bliss / To which some moved tranquillity was the key, / It persevered through life’s huge emptiness / Amid the blank denials of the world.

03.03_088:017 - It sent its voiceless prayer to the Unknown; / It listened for the footsteps of its hopes / Returning through the void immensities, / It waited for the fiat of the Word / That comes through the still self from the Supreme.


Canto 4 - 3.4: The Vision and the Boon

Section I - 89: O son of strength


03.04_089:001 - Then suddenly there rose a sacred stir.

03.04_089:002 - Amid the lifeless silence of the Void / In a solitude and an immensity / A sound came quivering like a loved footfall / Heard in the listening spaces of the soul; / A touch perturbed his fibres with delight.

03.04_089:003 - An influence had approached the mortal range, / A boundless Heart was near his longing heart, / A mystic Form enveloped his earthly shape.

03.04_089:004 - All at her contact broke from silence’ seal; / Spirit and body thrilled identified, / Linked in the grasp of an unspoken joy; / Mind, members, life were merged in ecstasy.

03.04_089:005 - Intoxicated as with nectarous rain / His nature’s passioning stretches flowed to her / Flashing with lightnings, mad with luminous wine.

03.04_089:006 - All was a limitless sea that heaved to the moon.

03.04_089:007 - A divinising stream possessed his veins, / His body’s cells awoke to spirit sense, / Each nerve became a burning thread of joy: / Tissue and flesh partook beatitude.

03.04_089:008 - Alight, the dun unplumbed subconscient caves / Thrilled with the prescience of her longed-for tread / And filled with flickering crests and praying tongues.

03.04_089:009 - Even lost in slumber, mute, inanimate / His very body answered to her power.

03.04_089:010 - The One he worshipped was within him now: / Flame-pure, ethereal-tressed a mighty Face / Appeared and lips moved by immortal words; / Lids, wisdom’s leaves, drooped over rapture’s orbs.

03.04_089:011 - A marble monument of ponderings, shone / A forehead, sight’s crypt, and large like ocean’s gaze / Towards Heaven two tranquil eyes of boundless thought / Looked into man’s and saw the god to come.

03.04_089:012 - A shape was seen on threshold Mind, a Voice / Absolute and wise in the heart’s chambers spoke: / “O Son of Strength who climbst creation’s peaks, / No soul is thy companion in the light; / Alone thou standest at the eternal doors.

03.04_089:013 - What thou hast won is thine, but ask no more.

03.04_089:014 - O Spirit aspiring in an ignorant frame, / O Voice arisen from the Inconscient’s world, / How shalt thou speak for men whose hearts are dumb, / Make purblind earth the soul’s seer-vision’s home / Or lighten the burden of the senseless globe?

03.04_089:015 - I am the Mystery beyond reach of mind, / I am the goal of the travail of the suns; / My fire and sweetness are the cause of life.

03.04_089:016 - But too immense my danger and my joy.

03.04_089:017 - Awake not the immeasurable descent, / Speak not my secret name to hostile Time; / Man is too weak to bear the Infinite’s weight.

03.04_089:018 - Truth born too soon might break the imperfect earth.

03.04_089:019 - Leave the all-seeing Power to hew its way: / In thy single vast achievement reign apart / Helping the world with thy great lonely days.

03.04_089:020 - I ask thee not to merge thy heart of flame / In the Immobile’s wide uncaring bliss, / Turned from the fruitless motion of the years, / Deserting the fierce labour of the worlds, / Aloof from beings, lost in the Alone.

03.04_089:021 - How shall thy mighty spirit brook repose / While Death is still unconquered on the earth / And Time a field of suffering and pain?

03.04_089:022 - Thy soul was born to share the laden Force; / Obey thy nature and fulfil thy fate: / Accept the difficulty and godlike toil, / For the slow-paced omniscient purpose live.

03.04_089:023 - The Enigma’s knot is tied in human kind.

03.04_089:024 - A lightning from the heights that think and plan, / Ploughing the air of life with vanishing trails, / Man, sole awake in an unconscious world, / Aspires in vain to change the cosmic dream.

03.04_089:025 - Arrived from some half-luminous Beyond / He is a stranger in the mindless vasts; / A traveller in his oft-shifting home / Amid the tread of many infinitudes, / He has pitched a tent of life in desert Space.

03.04_089:026 - Heaven’s fixed regard beholds him from above, / In the house of Nature a perturbing guest, / A voyager twixt Thought’s inconstant shores, / A hunter of unknown and beautiful Powers, / A nomad of the far mysterious Light, / In the wide ways a little spark of God.

03.04_089:027 - Against his spirit all is in dire league, / A Titan influence stops his Godward gaze.

03.04_089:028 - Around him hungers the unpitying Void, / The eternal Darkness seeks him with her hands, / Inscrutable Energies drive him and deceive, / Immense implacable deities oppose.

03.04_089:029 - An inert Soul and a somnambulist Force / Have made a world estranged from life and thought; / The Dragon of the dark foundations keeps / Unalterable the law of Chance and Death; / On his long way through Time and Circumstance / The grey-hued riddling nether shadow-Sphinx, / Her dreadful paws upon the swallowing sands, / Awaits him armed with the soul-slaying word: / Across his path sits the dim camp of Night.

03.04_089:030 - His day is a moment in perpetual Time; / He is the prey of the minutes and the hours.

03.04_089:031 - Assailed on earth and unassured of heaven, / Descended here unhappy and sublime, / A link between the demigod and the beast, / He knows not his own greatness nor his aim; / He has forgotten why he has come and whence; / His spirit and his members are at war; / His heights break off too low to reach the skies, / His mass is buried in the animal mire.

03.04_089:032 - A strange antinomy is his nature’s rule.

03.04_089:033 - A riddle of opposites is made his field: / Freedom he asks but needs to live in bonds, / He has need of darkness to perceive some light / And need of grief to feel a little bliss; / He has need of death to find a greater life.

03.04_089:034 - All sides he sees and turns to every call; / He has no certain light by which to walk; / His life is a blind-man’s-buff, a hide and seek; / He seeks himself and from himself he runs; / Meeting himself, he thinks it other than he.

03.04_089:035 - Always he builds, but finds no constant ground, / Always he journeys, but nowhere arrives; / He would guide the world, himself he cannot guide; / He would save his soul, his life he cannot save.

03.04_089:036 - The light his soul has brought his mind has lost; / All he has learned is soon again in doubt; / A sun to him seems the shadow of his thoughts, / Then all is shadow again and nothing is true: / Unknowing what he does or whither he tends / He fabricates signs of the Real in Ignorance.

03.04_089:037 - He has hitched his mortal error to Truth’s star.

03.04_089:038 - Wisdom attracts him with her luminous masks, / But never has he seen the face behind: / A giant Ignorance surrounds his lore.

03.04_089:039 - Assigned to meet the cosmic mystery / In the dumb figure of a material world, / His passport of entry false and his personage, / He is compelled to be what he is not; / He obeys the Inconscience he has come to rule / And sinks in Matter to fulfil his soul.

03.04_089:040 - Awakened from her lower driven forms / The Earth-Mother gave her forces to his hands / And painfully he guards the heavy trust; / His mind is a lost torch-bearer on her roads.

03.04_089:041 - Illumining breath to think and plasm to feel, / He labours with his slow and sceptic brain / Helped by the reason’s vacillating fires, / To make his thought and will a magic door / For knowledge to enter the darkness of the world / And love to rule a realm of strife and hate.

03.04_089:042 - A mind impotent to reconcile heaven and earth / And tied to Matter with a thousand bonds, / He lifts himself to be a conscious god.

03.04_089:043 - Even when a glory of wisdom crowns his brow, / When mind and spirit shed a grandiose ray / To exalt this product of the sperm and gene, / This alchemist’s miracle from plasm and gas, / And he who shared the animal’s run and crawl, / Lifts his thought-stature to the Immortal’s heights, / His life still keeps the human middle way; / His body he resigns to death and pain, / Abandoning Matter, his too heavy charge.

03.04_089:044 - A thaumaturge sceptic of miracles, / A spirit left sterile of its occult power / By an unbelieving brain and credulous heart / He leaves the world to end where it began: / His work unfinished he claims a heavenly prize.

03.04_089:045 - Thus has he missed creation’s absolute.

03.04_089:046 - Halfway he stops his star of destiny: / A vast and vain long-tried experiment, / An ill-served high conception doubtfully done, / The world’s life falters on not seeing its goal,— / A zigzag towards unknown dangerous ground / Ever repeating its habitual walk, / Ever retreating after marches long / And hardiest victories without sure result, / Drawn endlessly an inconclusive game.

03.04_089:047 - In an ill-fitting and voluminous robe / A radiant purpose still conceals its face, / A mighty blindness stumbles hoping on / Feeding its strength on gifts of luminous Chance.

03.04_089:048 - Because the human instrument has failed, / The Godhead frustrate sleeps within its seed, / A spirit entangled in the forms it made.

03.04_089:049t - His failure is not failure whom God leads; / Through all the slow mysterious march goes on: / An immutable Power has made this mutable world; / A self-fulfilling transcendence treads man’s road; / The driver of the soul upon its path, / It knows its steps, its way is inevitable / And how shall the end be vain when God is guide? #assurance-of-salvation #divine-guide #divine-providence #reassurance #true-success #truth-of-things

03.04_089:050B - However man’s mind may tire or fail his flesh, / A will prevails cancelling his conscious choice: / The goal recedes, a bourneless vastness calls / Retreating into an immense Unknown; / There is no end to the world’s stupendous march, / There is no rest for the embodied soul.

03.04_089:051 - It must live on, describe all Time’s huge curve.

03.04_089:052 - An Influx presses from the closed Beyond / Forbidding to him rest and earthly ease, / Till he has found himself he cannot pause.

03.04_089:053t - A Light there is that leads, a Power that aids; / Unmarked, unfelt it sees in him and acts: / Ignorant, he forms the All-conscient in his depths, / Human, looks up to superhuman peaks: / A borrower of Supernature’s gold, / He paves his road to Immortality. #divine-grace #divine-reassurance #hidden-truth #secret-working #truth-of-things

03.04_089:054 - The high gods look on man and watch and choose / Today’s impossibles for the future’s base.

03.04_089:055 - His transience trembles with the Eternal’s touch, / His barriers cede beneath the Infinite’s tread; / The Immortals have their entries in his life: / The Ambassadors of the Unseen draw near; / A Splendour sullied by the mortal air, / Love passes through his heart, a wandering guest, / Beauty surrounds him for a magic hour, / He has visits of a large revealing joy, / Brief widenesses release him from himself, / Enticing towards a glory ever in front / Hopes of a deathless sweetness lure and leave.

03.04_089:056 - His mind is crossed by strange discovering fires, / Rare intimations lift his stumbling speech / To a moment’s kinship with the eternal Word; / A masque of wisdom circles through his brain / Perturbing him with glimpses half-divine.

03.04_089:057 - He lays his hands sometimes on the Unknown; / He communes sometimes with Eternity.

03.04_089:058 - A strange and grandiose symbol was his birth / And immortality and spirit-room / And pure perfection and a shadowless bliss / Are this afflicted creature’s mighty fate.

03.04_089:059 - In him the Earth-Mother sees draw near the change / Foreshadowed in her dumb and fiery depths, / A godhead drawn from her transmuted limbs, / An alchemy of Heaven on Nature’s base.

03.04_089:060 - Adept of the self-born unfailing line, / Leave not the light to die the ages bore, / Help still humanity’s blind and suffering life: / Obey thy spirit’s wide omnipotent urge.

03.04_089:061 - A witness to God’s parley with the Night / It leaned compassionate from immortal calm / And housed desire, the troubled seed of things.

03.04_089:062t - Assent to thy high self, create, endure. #commandments #divine-will #needs #spiritual-instruction #yoga

03.04_089:063 - Cease not from knowledge, let thy toil be vast, / No more in earthly limits pen thy force; / Equal thy work with long unending Time’s.

03.04_089:064 - Traveller upon the bare eternal heights, / Tread still the difficult and dateless path / Joining the cycles with its austere curve / Measured for man by the initiate Gods.

03.04_089:065 - My light shall be in thee, my strength thy force.

03.04_089:066 - Let not the impatient Titan drive thy heart, / Ask not the imperfect fruit, the partial prize.

03.04_089:067 - Only one boon, to greaten thy spirit, demand; / Only one joy, to raise thy kind, desire.

03.04_089:068 - Above blind fate and the antagonist powers / Moveless there stands a high unchanging Will; / To its omnipotence leave thy work’s result.

03.04_089:069 - All things shall change in God’s transfiguring hour.”


Section I - 90: prayer


03.04_090:001 - August and sweet sank hushed that mighty Voice.

03.04_090:002 - Nothing now moved in the vast brooding space: / A stillness came upon the listening world, / A mute immensity of the Eternal’s peace.

03.04_090:003 - But Aswapathy’s heart replied to her, / A cry amid the silence of the Vasts: / “How shall I rest content with mortal days / And the dull measure of terrestrial things, / I who have seen behind the cosmic mask / The glory and the beauty of thy face?

03.04_090:004 - Hard is the doom to which thou bindst thy sons!

03.04_090:005 - How long shall our spirits battle with the Night / And bear defeat and the brute yoke of Death, / We who are vessels of a deathless Force / And builders of the godhead of the race?

03.04_090:006 - Or if it is thy work I do below / Amid the error and waste of human life / In the vague light of man’s half-conscious mind, / Why breaks not in some distant gleam of thee?

03.04_090:007 - Ever the centuries and millenniums pass.

03.04_090:008 - Where in the greyness is thy coming’s ray?

03.04_090:009 - Where is the thunder of thy victory’s wings?

03.04_090:010 - Only we hear the feet of passing gods.

03.04_090:011 - A plan in the occult eternal Mind / Mapped out to backward and prophetic sight, / The aeons ever repeat their changeless round, / The cycles all rebuild and ever aspire.

03.04_090:012 - All we have done is ever still to do.

03.04_090:013 - All breaks and all renews and is the same.

03.04_090:014 - Huge revolutions of life’s fruitless gyre, / The new-born ages perish like the old, / As if the sad Enigma kept its right / Till all is done for which this scene was made.

03.04_090:015 - Too little the strength that now with us is born, / Too faint the light that steals through Nature’s lids, / Too scant the joy with which she buys our pain.

03.04_090:016 - In a brute world that knows not its own sense, / Thought-racked upon the wheel of birth we live, / The instruments of an impulse not our own / Moved to achieve with our heart’s blood for price / Half-knowledge, half-creations that soon tire.

03.04_090:017 - A foiled immortal soul in perishing limbs, / Baffled and beaten back we labour still; / Annulled, frustrated, spent, we still survive.

03.04_090:018 - In anguish we labour that from us may rise / A larger-seeing man with nobler heart, / A golden vessel of the incarnate Truth, / The executor of the divine attempt / Equipped to wear the earthly body of God, / Communicant and prophet and lover and king.

03.04_090:019 - I know that thy creation cannot fail.

03.04_090:020 - For even through the mists of mortal thought / Infallible are thy mysterious steps, / And, though Necessity dons the garb of Chance, / Hidden in the blind shifts of Fate she keeps / The slow calm logic of Infinity’s pace / And the inviolate sequence of its will.

03.04_090:021 - All life is fixed in an ascending scale / And adamantine is the evolving Law; / In the beginning is prepared the close.

03.04_090:022 - This strange irrational product of the mire, / This compromise between the beast and God, / Is not the crown of thy miraculous world.

03.04_090:023 - I know there shall inform the inconscient cells, / At one with Nature and at height with heaven, / A spirit vast as the containing sky / And swept with ecstasy from invisible founts, / A god come down and greater by the fall.

03.04_090:024 - A power arose out of my slumber’s cell.

03.04_090:025 - Abandoning the tardy limp of the hours / And the inconstant blink of mortal sight, / There where the Thinker sleeps in too much light / And intolerant flames the lone all-witnessing Eye / Hearing the word of Fate from Silence’ heart / In the endless moment of Eternity, / It saw from timelessness the works of Time.

03.04_090:026 - Overpassed were the leaden formulas of the Mind, / Overpowered the obstacle of mortal Space: / The unfolding Image showed the things to come.

03.04_090:027 - A giant dance of Shiva tore the past, / There was a thunder as of worlds that fall; / Earth was o’errun with fire and the roar of Death / Clamouring to slay a world his hunger had made; / There was a clangour of Destruction’s wings: / The Titan’s battle-cry was in my ears, / Alarm and rumour shook the armoured Night.

03.04_090:028 - I saw the Omnipotent’s flaming pioneers / Over the heavenly verge which turns towards life / Come crowding down the amber stairs of birth; / Forerunners of a divine multitude / Out of the paths of the morning star they came / Into the little room of mortal life.

03.04_090:029 - I saw them cross the twilight of an age, / The sun-eyed children of a marvellous dawn, / The great creators with wide brows of calm, / The massive barrier-breakers of the world / And wrestlers with destiny in her lists of will, / The labourers in the quarries of the gods, / The messengers of the Incommunicable, / The architects of immortality.

03.04_090:030 - Into the fallen human sphere they came, / Faces that wore the Immortal’s glory still, / Voices that communed still with the thoughts of God, / Bodies made beautiful by the Spirit’s light, / Carrying the magic word, the mystic fire, / Carrying the Dionysian cup of joy, / Approaching eyes of a diviner man, / Lips chanting an unknown anthem of the soul, / Feet echoing in the corridors of Time.

03.04_090:031 - High priests of wisdom, sweetness, might and bliss, / Discoverers of beauty’s sunlit ways / And swimmers of Love’s laughing fiery floods / And dancers within rapture’s golden doors, / Their tread one day shall change the suffering earth / And justify the light on Nature’s face.

03.04_090:032 - Although Fate lingers in the high Beyond / And the work seems vain on which our heart’s force was spent, / All shall be done for which our pain was borne.

03.04_090:033 - Even as of old man came behind the beast / This high divine successor surely shall come / Behind man’s inefficient mortal pace, / Behind his vain labour, sweat and blood and tears: / He shall know what mortal mind barely durst think, / He shall do what the heart of the mortal could not dare.

03.04_090:034 - Inheritor of the toil of human time / He shall take on him the burden of the gods; / All heavenly light shall visit the earth’s thoughts, / The might of heaven shall fortify earthly hearts; / Earth’s deeds shall touch the superhuman’s height, / Earth’s seeing widened into the infinite.

03.04_090:035 - Heavy unchanged weighs still the imperfect world; / The splendid youth of Time has passed and failed; / Heavy and long are the years our labour counts / And still the seals are firm upon man’s soul / And weary is the ancient Mother’s heart.

03.04_090:036 - O Truth defended in thy secret sun, / Voice of her mighty musings in shut heavens / On things withdrawn within her luminous depths, / O Wisdom-Splendour, Mother of the universe, / Creatrix, the Eternal’s artist Bride, / Linger not long with thy transmuting hand / Pressed vainly on one golden bar of Time, / As if Time dare not open its heart to God.

03.04_090:037 - O radiant fountain of the world’s delight / World-free and unattainable above, / O Bliss who ever dwellst deep hid within / While men seek thee outside and never find, / Mystery and Muse with hieratic tongue, / Incarnate the white passion of thy force, / Mission to earth some living form of thee.

03.04_090:038 - One moment fill with thy eternity, / Let thy infinity in one body live, / All-Knowledge wrap one mind in seas of light, / All-Love throb single in one human heart.

03.04_090:039 - Immortal, treading the earth with mortal feet / All heaven’s beauty crowd in earthly limbs!

03.04_090:040 - Omnipotence, girdle with the power of God / Movements and moments of a mortal will, / Pack with the eternal might one human hour / And with one gesture change all future time.

03.04_090:041 - Let a great word be spoken from the heights / And one great act unlock the doors of Fate.”


Section I - 91: consenting voice


03.04_091:001 - His prayer sank down in the resisting Night / Oppressed by the thousand forces that deny, / As if too weak to climb to the Supreme.

03.04_091:002 - But there arose a wide consenting Voice; / The spirit of beauty was revealed in sound: / Light floated round the marvellous Vision’s brow / And on her lips the Immortal’s joy took shape.

03.04_091:003 - “O strong forerunner, I have heard thy cry.

03.04_091:004 - One shall descend and break the iron Law, / Change Nature’s doom by the lone Spirit’s power.

03.04_091:005 - A limitless Mind that can contain the world, / A sweet and violent heart of ardent calms / Moved by the passions of the gods shall come.

03.04_091:006 - All mights and greatnesses shall join in her; / Beauty shall walk celestial on the earth, / Delight shall sleep in the cloud-net of her hair / And in her body as on his homing tree / Immortal Love shall beat his glorious wings.

03.04_091:007 - A music of griefless things shall weave her charm; / The harps of the Perfect shall attune her voice, / The streams of Heaven shall murmur in her laugh, / Her lips shall be the honeycombs of God, / Her limbs his golden jars of ecstasy, / Her breasts the rapture-flowers of Paradise.

03.04_091:008 - She shall bear Wisdom in her voiceless bosom, / Strength shall be with her like a conqueror’s sword / And from her eyes the Eternal’s bliss shall gaze.

03.04_091:009 - A seed shall be sown in Death’s tremendous hour, / A branch of heaven transplant to human soil; / Nature shall overleap her mortal step; / Fate shall be changed by an unchanging will.”


Section I - 92: vanished the splendor


03.04_092:001 - As a flame disappears in endless Light / Immortally extinguished in its source, / Vanished the splendour and was stilled the word.

03.04_092:002 - An echo of delight that once was close, / The harmony journeyed towards some distant hush, / A music failing in the ear of trance, / A cadence called by distant cadences, / A voice that trembled into strains withdrawn.

03.04_092:003 - Her form retreated from the longing earth / Forsaking nearness to the abandoned sense, / Ascending to her unattainable home.

03.04_092:004 - Lone, brilliant, vacant lay the inner fields; / All was unfilled inordinate spirit space, / Indifferent, waste, a desert of bright peace.

03.04_092:005 - Then a line moved on the far edge of calm: / The warm-lipped sentient soft terrestrial wave, / A quick and many-murmured moan and laugh, / Came gliding in upon white feet of sound.

03.04_092:006 - Unlocked was the deep glory of Silence’ heart; / The absolute unmoving stillnesses / Surrendered to the breath of mortal air, / Dissolving boundlessly the heavens of trance / Collapsed to waking mind. Eternity / Cast down its incommunicable lids / Over its solitudes remote from ken / Behind the voiceless mystery of sleep.

03.04_092:007 - The grandiose respite failed, the wide release.

03.04_092:008 - Across the light of fast-receding planes / That fled from him as from a falling star / Compelled to fill his human house in Time / His soul drew back into the speed and noise / Of the vast business of created things.

03.04_092:009 - A chariot of the marvels of the heavens / Broad-based to bear the gods on fiery wheels, / Flaming he swept through the spiritual gates.

03.04_092:010 - The mortal stir received him in its midst.

03.04_092:011 - Once more he moved amid material scenes, / Lifted by intimations from the heights / And twixt the pauses of the building brain / Touched by the thoughts that skim the fathomless surge / Of Nature and wing back to hidden shores.

03.04_092:012 - The eternal seeker in the aeonic field / Besieged by the intolerant press of hours / Again was strong for great swift-footed deeds.

03.04_092:013 - Awake beneath the ignorant vault of Night, / He saw the unnumbered people of the stars / And heard the questioning of the unsatisfied flood / And toiled with the form-maker, measuring Mind.

03.04_092:014 - A wanderer from the occult invisible suns / Accomplishing the fate of transient things, / A god in the figure of the arisen beast, / He raised his brow of conquest to the heavens / Establishing the empire of the soul / On Matter and its bounded universe / As on a solid rock in infinite seas.

03.04_092:015 - The Lord of Life resumed his mighty rounds / In the scant field of the ambiguous globe.

Canto Book4 - 4: THE BOOK OF BIRTH AND QUEST

Canto 1 - 4.1: The Birth and Childhood of the Flame

Section I - 93: hastening


04.01_093:001 - A maenad of the cycles of desire / Around a Light she must not dare to touch, / Hastening towards a far-off unknown goal / Earth followed the endless journey of the Sun.

04.01_093:002 - A mind but half-awake in the swing of the void / On the bosom of Inconscience dreamed out life / And bore this finite world of thought and deed / Across the immobile trance of the Infinite.

04.01_093:003 - A vast immutable silence with her ran: / Prisoner of speed upon a jewelled wheel, / She communed with the mystic heart in Space.

04.01_093:004 - Amid the ambiguous stillness of the stars / She moved towards some undisclosed event / And her rhythm measured the long whirl of Time.

04.01_093:005 - In ceaseless motion round the purple rim / Day after day sped by like coloured spokes, / And through a glamour of shifting hues of air / The seasons drew in linked significant dance / The symbol pageant of the changing year.

04.01_093:006 - Across the burning langour of the soil / Paced Summer with his pomp of violent noons / And stamped his tyranny of torrid light / And the blue seal of a great burnished sky.

04.01_093:007 - Next through its fiery swoon or clotted knot / Rain-tide burst in upon torn wings of heat, / Startled with lightnings air’s unquiet drowse, / Lashed with life-giving streams the torpid soil, / Overcast with flare and sound and storm-winged dark / The star-defended doors of heaven’s dim sleep, / Or from the gold eye of her paramour / Covered with packed cloud-veils the earth’s brown face.

04.01_093:008 - Armies of revolution crossed the time-field, / The clouds’ unending march besieged the world, / Tempests’ pronunciamentos claimed the sky / And thunder drums announced the embattled gods.

04.01_093:009 - A traveller from unquiet neighbouring seas / The dense maned monsoon rode neighing through earth’s hours: / Thick now the emissary javelins: / Enormous lightnings split the horizon’s rim / And, hurled from the quarters as from contending camps, / Married heaven’s edges steep and bare and blind: / A surge and hiss and onset of huge rain, / The long straight sleet-drift, clamours of winged storm-charge, / Throngs of wind-faces, rushing of wind-feet / Hurrying swept through the prone afflicted plains: / Heaven’s waters trailed and dribbled through the drowned land.

04.01_093:010 - Then all was a swift stride, a sibilant race, / Or all was tempest’s shout and water’s fall.

04.01_093:011 - A dimness sagged on the grey floor of day, / Its dingy sprawling length joined morn to eve, / Wallowing in sludge and shower it reached black dark.

04.01_093:012 - Day a half darkness wore as its dull dress.

04.01_093:013 - Light looked into dawn’s tarnished glass and met / Its own face there, twin to a half-lit night’s: / Downpour and drip and seeping mist swayed all / And turned dry soil to bog and reeking mud: / Earth was a quagmire, heaven a dismal block.

04.01_093:014 - None saw through dank drenched weeks the dungeon sun.

04.01_093:015 - Even when no turmoil vexed air’s sombre rest, / Or a faint ray glimmered through weeping clouds / As a sad smile gleams veiled by returning tears, / All promised brightness failed at once denied / Or, soon condemned, died like a brief-lived hope.

04.01_093:016 - Then a last massive deluge thrashed dead mire / And a subsiding mutter left all still, / Or only the muddy creep of sinking floods / Or only a whisper and green toss of trees.

04.01_093:017 - Earth’s mood now changed; she lay in lulled repose, / The hours went by with slow contented tread: / A wide and tranquil air remembered peace, / Earth was the comrade of a happy sun.

04.01_093:018 - A calmness neared as of the approach of God, / A light of musing trance lit soil and sky.

04.01_093:019 - And an identity and ecstasy / Filled meditation’s solitary heart.

04.01_093:020 - A dream loitered in the dumb mind of Space, / Time opened its chambers of felicity, / An exaltation entered and a hope: / An inmost self looked up to a heavenlier height, / An inmost thought kindled a hidden flame / And the inner sight adored an unseen sun.

04.01_093:021 - Three thoughtful seasons passed with shining tread / And scanning one by one the pregnant hours / Watched for a flame that lurked in luminous depths, / The vigil of some mighty birth to come.

04.01_093:022 - Autumn led in the glory of her moons / And dreamed in the splendour of her lotus pools / And Winter and Dew-time laid their calm cool hands / On Nature’s bosom still in a half sleep / And deepened with hues of lax and mellow ease / The tranquil beauty of the waning year.

04.01_093:023 - Then Spring, an ardent lover, leaped through leaves / And caught the earth-bride in his eager clasp; / His advent was a fire of irised hues, / His arms were a circle of the arrival of joy.

04.01_093:024 - His voice was a call to the Transcendent’s sphere / Whose secret touch upon our mortal lives / Keeps ever new the thrill that made the world, / Remoulds an ancient sweetness to new shapes / And guards intact unchanged by death and Time / The answer of our hearts to Nature’s charm / And keeps for ever new, yet still the same, / The throb that ever wakes to the old delight / And beauty and rapture and the joy to live.

04.01_093:025 - His coming brought the magic and the spell, / At his touch life’s tired heart grew glad and young; / He made joy a willing prisoner in her breast.

04.01_093:026 - His grasp was a young god’s upon earth’s limbs: / Changed by the passion of his divine outbreak / He made her body beautiful with his kiss.

04.01_093:027 - Impatient for felicity he came, / High-fluting with the coïl’s happy voice, / His peacock turban trailing on the trees; / His breath was a warm summons to delight, / The dense voluptuous azure was his gaze.

04.01_093:028 - A soft celestial urge surprised the blood / Rich with the instinct of God’s sensuous joys; / Revealed in beauty, a cadence was abroad / Insistent on the rapture-thrill in life: / Immortal movements touched the fleeting hours.

04.01_093:029 - A godlike packed intensity of sense / Made it a passionate pleasure even to breathe; / All sights and voices wove a single charm.

04.01_093:030 - The life of the enchanted globe became / A storm of sweetness and of light and song, / A revel of colour and of ecstasy, / A hymn of rays, a litany of cries: / A strain of choral priestly music sang / And, swung on the swaying censer of the trees, / A sacrifice of perfume filled the hours.

04.01_093:031 - Asocas burned in crimson spots of flame, / Pure like the breath of an unstained desire / White jasmines haunted the enamoured air, / Pale mango-blossoms fed the liquid voice / Of the love-maddened coïl, and the brown bee / Muttered in fragrance mid the honey-buds.

04.01_093:032 - The sunlight was a great god’s golden smile.

04.01_093:033 - All Nature was at beauty’s festival.


Section I - 94: goddess in her house of gold


04.01_094:001 - In this high signal moment of the gods / Answering earth’s yearning and her cry for bliss / A greatness from our other countries came.

04.01_094:002 - A silence in the noise of earthly things / Immutably revealed the secret Word, / A mightier influx filled the oblivious clay: / A lamp was lit, a sacred image made.

04.01_094:003 - A mediating ray had touched the earth / Bridging the gulf between man’s mind and God’s; / Translating heaven into a human shape / Its brightness linked our transience to the Unknown.

04.01_094:004 - A spirit of its celestial source aware / Descended into earth’s imperfect mould / And wept not fallen to mortality, / But looked on all with large and tranquil eyes.

04.01_094:005 - One had returned from the transcendent planes / And bore anew the load of mortal breath, / Who had striven of old with our darkness and our pain; / She took again her divine unfinished task: / Survivor of death and the aeonic years, / Once more with her fathomless heart she fronted Time.

04.01_094:006 - Again there was renewed, again revealed / The ancient closeness by earth-vision veiled, / The secret contact broken off in Time, / A consanguinity of earth and heaven, / Between the human portion toiling here / And an as yet unborn and limitless Force.

04.01_094:007 - Again the mystic deep attempt began, / The daring wager of the cosmic game.

04.01_094:008 - For since upon this blind and whirling globe / Earth-plasm first quivered with the illumining mind / And life invaded the material sheath / Afflicting Inconscience with the need to feel, / Since in Infinity’s silence woke a word, / A Mother wisdom works in Nature’s breast / To pour delight on the heart of toil and want / And press perfection on life’s stumbling powers, / Impose heaven-sentience on the obscure abyss / And make dumb Matter conscious of its God.

04.01_094:009 - Although our fallen minds forget to climb, / Although our human stuff resists or breaks, / She keeps her will that hopes to divinise clay; / Failure cannot repress, defeat o’erthrow; / Time cannot weary her nor the Void subdue, / The ages have not made her passion less; / No victory she admits of Death or Fate.

04.01_094:010 - Always she drives the souls to new attempt; / Always her magical infinitude / Forces to aspire the inert brute elements; / As one who has all infinity to waste, / She scatters the seed of the Eternal’s strength / On a half-animate and crumbling mould, / Plants heaven’s delight in the heart’s passionate mire, / Pours godhead’s seekings into a bare beast frame, / Hides immortality in a mask of death.

04.01_094:011 - Once more that Will put on an earthly shape.

04.01_094:012 - A Mind empowered from Truth’s immutable seat / Was framed for vision and interpreting act / And instruments were sovereignly designed / To express divinity in terrestrial signs.

04.01_094:013 - Outlined by the pressure of this new descent / A lovelier body formed than earth had known.

04.01_094:014 - As yet a prophecy only and a hint, / The glowing arc of a charmed unseen whole, / It came into the sky of mortal life / Bright like the crescent horn of a gold moon / Returning in a faint illumined eve.

04.01_094:015 - At first glimmering like an unshaped idea / Passive she lay sheltered in wordless sleep, / Involved and drowned in Matter’s giant trance, / An infant heart of the deep-caved world-plan / In cradle of divine inconscience rocked / By the universal ecstasy of the suns.

04.01_094:016 - Some missioned Power in the half-wakened frame / Nursed a transcendent birth’s dumb glorious seed / For which this vivid tenement was made.

04.01_094:017 - But soon the link of soul with form grew sure; / Flooded was the dim cave with slow conscient light, / The seed grew into a delicate marvellous bud, / The bud disclosed a great and heavenly bloom.

04.01_094:018 - At once she seemed to found a mightier race.

04.01_094:019 - Arrived upon the strange and dubious globe / The child remembering inly a far home / Lived guarded in her spirit’s luminous cell, / Alone mid men in her diviner kind.

04.01_094:020 - Even in her childish movements could be felt / The nearness of a light still kept from earth, / Feelings that only eternity could share, / Thoughts natural and native to the gods.

04.01_094:021 - As needing nothing but its own rapt flight / Her nature dwelt in a strong separate air / Like a strange bird with large rich-coloured breast / That sojourns on a secret fruited bough / Lost in the emerald glory of the woods / Or flies above divine unreachable tops.

04.01_094:022 - Harmoniously she impressed the earth with heaven.

04.01_094:023 - Aligned to a swift rhythm of sheer delight / And singing to themselves her days went by; / Each minute was a throb of beauty’s heart, / The hours were tuned to a sweet-toned content / Which asked for nothing, but took all life gave / Sovereignly as her nature’s inborn right.

04.01_094:024 - Near was her spirit to its parent Sun, / The Breath within to the eternal joy.

04.01_094:025 - The first fair life that breaks from Nature’s swoon, / Mounts in a line of rapture to the skies; / Absorbed in its own happy urge it lives, / Sufficient to itself, yet turned to all.

04.01_094:026 - It has no seen communion with its world, / No open converse with surrounding things.

04.01_094:027 - There is a oneness native and occult / That needs no instruments and erects no form; / In unison it grows with all that is, / All contacts it assumes into its trance, / Laugh-tossed consents to the wind’s kiss and takes / Transmutingly the shocks of sun and breeze: / A blissful yearning riots in its leaves, / A magic passion trembles in its blooms, / Its boughs aspire in hushed felicity.

04.01_094:028 - An occult godhead of this beauty is cause, / The spirit and intimate guest of all this charm, / This sweetness’s priestess and this reverie’s muse.

04.01_094:029 - Invisibly protected from our sense / The Dryad lives drenched in a deeper ray / And feels another air of storms and calms / And quivers inwardly with mystic rain.

04.01_094:030 - This at a heavenlier height was shown in her.

04.01_094:031 - Even when she bent to meet earth’s intimacies / Her spirit kept the stature of the gods; / It stooped but was not lost in Matter’s reign.

04.01_094:032 - A world translated was her gleaming mind, / And marvel-mooned bright crowding fantasies / Fed with spiritual sustenance of dreams / The ideal goddess in her house of gold.

04.01_094:033 - Aware of forms to which our eyes are closed, / Conscious of nearnesses we cannot feel, / The Power within her shaped her moulding sense / In deeper figures than our surface types.

04.01_094:034 - An invisible sunlight ran within her veins / And flooded her brain with heavenly brilliancies / That woke a wider sight than earth could know.

04.01_094:035 - Outlined in the sincerity of that ray / Her springing childlike thoughts were richly turned / Into luminous patterns of her soul’s deep truth, / And from her eyes she cast another look / On all around her than man’s ignorant view.

04.01_094:036 - All objects were to her shapes of living selves / And she perceived a message from her kin / In each awakening touch of outward things.

04.01_094:037 - Each was a symbol power, a vivid flash / In the circuit of infinities half-known; / Nothing was alien or inanimate, / Nothing without its meaning or its call.

04.01_094:038 - For with a greater Nature she was one.

04.01_094:039 - As from the soil sprang glory of branch and flower, / As from the animal’s life rose thinking man, / A new epiphany appeared in her.

04.01_094:040 - A mind of light, a life of rhythmic force, / A body instinct with hidden divinity / Prepared an image of the coming god; / And when the slow rhyme of the expanding years / And the rich murmurous swarm-work of the days / Had honey-packed her sense and filled her limbs, / Accomplishing the moon-orb of her grace, / Self-guarded in the silence of her strength / Her solitary greatness was not less.

04.01_094:041 - Nearer the godhead to the surface pressed, / A sun replacing childhood’s nebula / Sovereign in a blue and lonely sky.

04.01_094:042 - Upward it rose to grasp the human scene: / The strong Inhabitant turned to watch her field, / A lovelier light assumed her spirit brow / And sweet and solemn grew her musing gaze; / Celestial-human deep warm slumbrous fires / Woke in the long fringed glory of her eyes / Like altar-burnings in a mysteried shrine.

04.01_094:043 - Out of those crystal windows gleamed a will / That brought a large significance to life.

04.01_094:044 - Holding her forehead’s candid stainless space / Behind the student arch a noble power / Of wisdom looked from light on transient things.

04.01_094:045 - A scout of victory in a vigil tower, / Her aspiration called high destiny down; / A silent warrior paced in her city of strength / Inviolate, guarding Truth’s diamond throne.

04.01_094:046 - A nectarous haloed moon her passionate heart / Loved all and spoke no word and made no sign, / But kept her bosom’s rapturous secrecy / A blissful ardent moved and voiceless world.

04.01_094:047 - Proud, swift and joyful ran the wave of life / Within her like a stream in Paradise.

04.01_094:048 - Many high gods dwelt in one beautiful home; / Yet was her nature’s orb a perfect whole, / Harmonious like a chant with many tones, / Immense and various like a universe. #favorite

04.01_094:049 - The body that held this greatness seemed almost / An image made of heaven’s transparent light.

04.01_094:050 - Its charm recalled things seen in vision’s hours, / A golden bridge spanning a faery flood, / A moon-touched palm tree single by a lake / Companion of the wide and glimmering peace, / A murmur as of leaves in Paradise / Moving when feet of the Immortals pass, / A fiery halo over sleeping hills, / A strange and starry head alone in Night.


Canto 2 - 4.2: The Growth of the Flame

Section I - 95: to her alone


04.02_095:001 - A land of mountains and wide sun-beat plains / And giant rivers pacing to vast seas, / A field of creation and spiritual hush, / Silence swallowing life’s acts into the deeps, / Of thought’s transcendent climb and heavenward leap, / A brooding world of reverie and trance, / Filled with the mightiest works of God and man, / Where Nature seemed a dream of the Divine / And beauty and grace and grandeur had their home, / Harboured the childhood of the incarnate Flame.

04.02_095:002 - Over her watched millennial influences / And the deep godheads of a grandiose past / Looked on her and saw the future’s godheads come / As if this magnet drew their powers unseen.

04.02_095:003 - Earth’s brooding wisdom spoke to her still breast; / Mounting from mind’s last peaks to mate with gods, / Making earth’s brilliant thoughts a springing board / To dive into the cosmic vastnesses, / The knowledge of the thinker and the seer / Saw the unseen and thought the unthinkable, / Opened the enormous doors of the unknown, / Rent Man’s horizons into infinity.

04.02_095:004 - A shoreless sweep was lent to the mortal’s acts, / And art and beauty sprang from the human depths; / Nature and soul vied in nobility.

04.02_095:005 - Ethics the human keyed to imitate heaven; / The harmony of a rich culture’s tones / Refined the sense and magnified its reach / To hear the unheard and glimpse the invisible / And taught the soul to soar beyond things known / Inspiring life to greaten and break its bounds / Aspiring to the Immortals’ unseen world.

04.02_095:006 - Leaving earth’s safety daring wings of Mind / Bore her above the trodden fields of thought / Crossing the mystic seas of the Beyond / To live on eagle heights near to the Sun.

04.02_095:007 - There wisdom sits on her eternal throne.

04.02_095:008 - All her life’s turns led her to symbol doors / Admitting to secret Powers that were her kin; / Adept of truth, initiate of bliss, / A mystic acolyte trained in Nature’s school, / Aware of the marvel of created things / She laid the secrecies of her heart’s deep muse / Upon the altar of the Wonderful; / Her hours were ritual in a timeless fane; / Her acts became gestures of sacrifice.

04.02_095:009 - Invested with a rhythm of higher spheres / The word was used as a hieratic means / For the release of the imprisoned spirit / Into communion with its comrade gods.

04.02_095:010 - Or it helped to beat out new expressive forms / Of that which labours in the heart of life, / Some immemorial Soul in men and things, / Seeker of the Unknown and the Unborn / Carrying a light from the Ineffable / To rend the veil of the last mysteries.

04.02_095:011 - Intense philosophies pointed earth to heaven / Or on foundations broad as cosmic Space / Upraised the earth-mind to superhuman heights.

04.02_095:012 - Overpassing lines that please the outward eyes / But hide the sight of that which lives within / Sculpture and painting concentrated sense / Upon an inner vision’s motionless verge, / Revealed a figure of the invisible, / Unveiled all Nature’s meaning in a form, / Or caught into a body the Divine.

04.02_095:013 - The architecture of the Infinite / Discovered here its inward-musing shapes / Captured into wide breadths of soaring stone: / Music brought down celestial yearnings, song / Held the merged heart absorbed in rapturous depths, / Linking the human with the cosmic cry; / The world-interpreting movements of the dance / Moulded idea and mood to a rhythmic sway / And posture; crafts minute in subtle lines / Eternised a swift moment’s memory / Or showed in a carving’s sweep, a cup’s design / The underlying patterns of the unseen: / Poems in largeness cast like moving worlds / And metres surging with the ocean’s voice / Translated by grandeurs locked in Nature’s heart / But thrown now into a crowded glory of speech / The beauty and sublimity of her forms, / The passion of her moments and her moods / Lifting the human word near to the god’s.

04.02_095:014 - Man’s eyes could look into the inner realms; / His scrutiny discovered number’s law / And organised the motions of the stars, / Mapped out the visible fashioning of the world, / Questioned the process of his thoughts or made / A theorised diagram of mind and life.

04.02_095:015 - These things she took in as her nature’s food, / But these alone could fill not her wide Self: / A human seeking limited by its gains, / To her they seemed the great and early steps / Hazardous of a young discovering spirit / Which saw not yet by its own native light; / It tapped the universe with testing knocks / Or stretched to find Truth-mind’s divining rod; / A growing out there was to numberless sides, / But not the widest seeing of the soul, / Not yet the vast direct immediate touch, / Nor yet the art and wisdom of the Gods.

04.02_095:016 - A boundless knowledge greater than man’s thought, / A happiness too high for heart and sense / Locked in the world and yearning for release / She felt in her; waiting as yet for form, / It asked for objects around which to grow / And natures strong to bear without recoil / The splendour of her native royalty, / Her greatness and her sweetness and her bliss, / Her might to possess and her vast power to love: / Earth made a stepping-stone to conquer heaven, / The soul saw beyond heaven’s limiting boundaries, / Met a great light from the Unknowable / And dreamed of a transcendent action’s sphere.

04.02_095:017 - Aware of the universal Self in all / She turned to living hearts and human forms; / Her soul’s reflections, complements, counterparts, / The close outlying portions of her being / Divided from her by walls of body and mind / Yet to her spirit bound by ties divine.

04.02_095:018 - Overcoming invisible hedge and masked defence / And the loneliness that separates soul from soul, / She wished to make all one immense embrace / That she might house in it all living things / Raised into a splendid point of seeing light / Out of division’s dense inconscient cleft, / And make them one with God and world and her.

04.02_095:019 - Only a few responded to her call: / Still fewer felt the screened divinity / And strove to mate its godhead with their own, / Approaching with some kinship to her heights.

04.02_095:020 - Uplifted towards luminous secrecies / Or conscious of some splendour hidden above / They leaped to find her in a moment’s flash, / Glimpsing a light in a celestial vast, / But could not keep the vision and the power / And fell back to life’s dull ordinary tone.

04.02_095:021 - A mind daring heavenly experiment, / Growing towards some largeness they felt near, / Testing the unknown’s bound with eager touch / They still were prisoned by their human grain: / They could not keep up with her tireless step; / Too small and eager for her large-paced will, / Too narrow to look with the unborn Infinite’s gaze / Their nature weary grew of things too great.

04.02_095:022 - For even the close partners of her thoughts / Who could have walked the nearest to her ray, / Worshipped the power and light they felt in her / But could not match the measure of her soul.

04.02_095:023 - A friend and yet too great wholly to know, / She walked in their front towards a greater light, / Their leader and queen over their hearts and souls, / One close to their bosoms, yet divine and far.

04.02_095:024 - Admiring and amazed they saw her stride / Attempting with a godlike rush and leap / Heights for their human stature too remote / Or with a slow great many-sided toil / Pushing towards aims they hardly could conceive; / Yet forced to be the satellites of her sun / They moved unable to forego her light, / Desiring they clutched at her with outstretched hands / Or followed stumbling in the paths she made.

04.02_095:025 - Or longing with their self of life and flesh / They clung to her for heart’s nourishment and support: / The rest they could not see in visible light; / Vaguely they bore her inner mightiness.

04.02_095:026 - Or bound by the senses and the longing heart, / Adoring with a turbid human love, / They could not grasp the mighty spirit she was / Or change by closeness to be even as she.

04.02_095:027 - Some felt her with their souls and thrilled with her; / A greatness felt near yet beyond mind’s grasp; / To see her was a summons to adore, / To be near her drew a high communion’s force.

04.02_095:028 - So men worship a god too great to know, / Too high, too vast to wear a limiting shape; / They feel a Presence and obey a might, / Adore a love whose rapture invades their breasts; / To a divine ardour quickening the heart-beats, / A law they follow greatening heart and life.

04.02_095:029 - Opened to a breath is the new diviner air, / Opened to man is a freer, happier world: / He sees high steps climbing to Self and Light.

04.02_095:030 - Her divine parts the soul’s allegiance called: / It saw, it felt; it knew the deity.

04.02_095:031 - Her will was puissant on their nature’s acts, / Her heart’s inexhaustible sweetness lured their hearts, / A being they loved whose bounds exceeded theirs; / Her measure they could not reach but bore her touch, / Answering with the flower’s answer to the sun / They gave themselves to her and asked no more.

04.02_095:032 - One greater than themselves, too wide for their ken, / Their minds could not understand nor wholly know, / Their lives replied to hers, moved at her words: / They felt a godhead and obeyed a call, / Answered to her lead and did her work in the world; / Their lives, their natures moved compelled by hers / As if the truth of their own larger selves / Put on an aspect of divinity / To exalt them to a pitch beyond their earth’s.

04.02_095:033 - They felt a larger future meet their walk; / She held their hands, she chose for them their paths: / They were moved by her towards great unknown things, / Faith drew them and the joy to feel themselves hers; / They lived in her, they saw the world with her eyes.

04.02_095:034 - Some turned to her against their nature’s bent; / Divided between wonder and revolt, / Drawn by her charm and mastered by her will, / Possessed by her, her striving to possess, / Impatient subjects, their tied longing hearts / Hugging the bonds close of which they most complained, / Murmured at a yoke they would have wept to lose, / The splendid yoke of her beauty and her love: / Others pursued her with life’s blind desires / And claiming all of her as their lonely own, / Hastened to engross her sweetness meant for all.

04.02_095:035 - As earth claims light for its lone separate need, / Demanding her for their sole jealous clasp / They asked from her movements bounded like their own / And to their smallness craved a like response.

04.02_095:036 - Or they repined that she surpassed their grip, / And hoped to bind her close with longing’s cords.

04.02_095:037 - Or finding her touch desired too strong to bear / They blamed her for a tyranny they loved, / Shrank into themselves as from too bright a sun, / Yet hankered for the splendour they refused.

04.02_095:038 - Angrily enamoured of her sweet passionate ray / The weakness of their earth could hardly bear, / They longed but cried out at the touch desired / Inapt to meet divinity so close, / Intolerant of a Force they could not house.

04.02_095:039 - Some drawn unwillingly by her divine sway / Endured it like a sweet but alien spell, / Unable to mount to levels too sublime / They yearned to draw her down to their own earth.

04.02_095:040 - Or forced to centre round her their passionate lives / They hoped to bind to their heart’s human needs / Her glory and grace that had enslaved their souls.



Section I - 96: her equal and her mate


04.02_096:001 - But mid this world, these hearts that answered her call, / None could stand up her equal and her mate.

04.02_096:002 - In vain she stooped to equal them with her heights, / Too pure that air was for small souls to breathe.

04.02_096:003 - These comrade selves to raise to her own wide breadths / Her heart desired and fill with her own power / That a diviner Force might enter life, / A breath of Godhead greaten human time.

04.02_096:004 - Although she leaned down to their littleness / Covering their lives with her strong passionate hands / And knew by sympathy their needs and wants / And dived in the shallow wave-depths of their lives / And met and shared their heart-beats of grief and joy / And bent to heal their sorrow and their pride, / Lavishing the might that was hers on her lone peak / To lift to it their aspiration’s cry / And though she drew their souls into her vast / And surrounded with the silence of her deeps / And held as the great Mother holds her own, / Only her earthly surface bore their charge / And mixed its fire with their mortality: / Her greater self lived sole, unclaimed, within.

04.02_096:005 - Oftener in dumb Nature’s stir and peace / A nearness she could feel serenely one; / The Force in her drew earth’s subhuman broods; / And to her spirit’s large and free delight / She joined the ardent-hued magnificent lives / Of animal and bird and flower and tree.

04.02_096:006 - They answered to her with the simple heart.

04.02_096:007 - In man a dim disturbing somewhat lives; / It knows but turns away from divine Light / Preferring the dark ignorance of the fall.

04.02_096:008 - Among the many who came drawn to her / Nowhere she found her partner of high tasks, / The comrade of her soul, her other self / Who was made with her, like God and Nature, one.

04.02_096:009 - Some near approached, were touched, caught fire, then failed.

04.02_096:010 - Too great was her demand, too pure her force.

04.02_096:011 - Thus lighting earth around her like a sun, / Yet in her inmost sky an orb aloof, / A distance severed her from those most close.

04.02_096:012 - Puissant, apart her soul as the gods live.


Section I - 97: image in a priestless shrine


04.02_097:001 - As yet with the great world she had no link; / In a small circle of young eager hearts, / Her spirit’s early reign and human school, / Her apprenticeship she made to life and death, / Content in her little garden of the gods / As blossoms a flower in an unvisited place.

04.02_097:002 - Earth nursed, unconscious still, the inhabiting flame, / Yet something deeply stirred and dimly knew; / There was a movement and a passionate call, / A rainbow dream, a hope of golden change; / Some secret wing of expectation beat, / A growing sense of something new and rare / And beautiful stole across the heart of Time.

04.02_097:003 - Then a faint whisper of her touched the soil, / Breathed like a hidden need the soul divines; / The eye of the great world discovered her, / A wonder lifted up its bardic voice.

04.02_097:004 - A key to a Light still kept in being’s care, / The sun-word of an ancient mystery’s sense, / Her name ran murmuring on the lips of men / Exalted and sweet like an inspired verse / Struck from the epic lyre of rumour’s winds / Or sung like a chanted thought by the poet Fame.

04.02_097:005 - But like a sacred symbol’s was that cult.

04.02_097:006 - Admired, unsought, intangible to the grasp / Her beauty and flaming strength were seen afar / Like lightning playing with the fallen day, / A glory unapproachably divine.

04.02_097:007 - There came to join her heart no heart’s approach, / No transient earthly love assailed her calm, / No hero passion had the strength to seize; / No eyes demanded her replying eyes. #favorite

04.02_097:008 - A Power within her awed the imperfect flesh; / The self-protecting genius in our clay / Divined the goddess in the woman’s shape / And drew back from a touch beyond its kind, / The earth-nature bound in the sense-life’s narrow make.

04.02_097:009 - The hearts of men are amorous of clay-kin / And bear not spirits lone and high who bring / Fire-intimations from the deathless planes / Too vast for souls not born to mate with heaven.

04.02_097:010 - Whoever is too great must lonely live, / Adored he walks in mighty solitude; / Vain is his labour to create his kins, / His only comrade is the Strength within.

04.02_097:011 - Thus was it for a while with Savitri, / All worshipped marvellingly, none dared to claim.

04.02_097:012 - Her mind sat high pouring its golden beams, / Her heart was a crowded temple of delight.

04.02_097:013 - A single lamp lit in perfection’s house, / A bright pure image in a priestless shrine, / Alone amid surrounding crowds she dwelt, / Apart in herself until her hour of fate.


Canto 3 - 4.3: The Call to the Quest

Section I - 98: hymn, shining answer


04.03_098:001 - A morn that seemed a new creation’s front, / Bringing a greater sunlight, happier skies, / Came, burdened with a beauty moved and strange / Out of the changeless origin of things.

04.03_098:002 - An ancient longing struck again new roots.

04.03_098:003 - The air drank deep of unfulfilled desire; / The high trees trembled with a wandering wind / Like souls that quiver at the approach of joy, / And in a bosom of green secrecy / For ever of its one love-note untired / A lyric coïl cried among the leaves.

04.03_098:004 - Away from the terrestrial murmur turned / Where transient calls and answers mix their flood, / King Aswapathy listened through the ray / To other sounds than meet the sense-formed ear.

04.03_098:005 - On a subtle interspace which rings our life / Unlocked were the inner spirit’s trance-closed doors: / The inaudible strain in Nature could be caught; / Across this cyclic tramp of eager lives, / Across the deep urgency of present cares, / Earth’s wordless hymn to the Ineffable / Arose from the ardent heart of the cosmic Void; / He heard the voice repressed of unborn Powers / Murmuring behind the luminous bars of Time.

04.03_098:006 - Again the mighty yearning raised its flame / That asks a perfect life on earth for men / And prays for certainty in the uncertain mind / And shadowless bliss for suffering human hearts / And Truth embodied in an ignorant world / And godhead divinising mortal forms.

04.03_098:007 - A word that leaped from some far sky of thought, / Admitted by the cowled receiving scribe / Traversed the echoing passages of his brain / And left its stamp on the recording cells.

04.03_098:008Ct - “O Force-compelled, Fate-driven earth-born race, / O petty adventurers in an infinite world / And prisoners of a dwarf humanity, / How long will you tread the circling tracks of mind / Around your little self and petty things? #boundaries-of-ignorance #divine-force #human-ignorance #self-emprisonment #wake-up-call

04.03_098:009 - But not for a changeless littleness were you meant, / Not for vain repetition were you built; / Out of the Immortal’s substance you were made; / Your actions can be swift revealing steps, / Your life a changeful mould for growing gods.

04.03_098:010 - A Seer, a strong Creator, is within, / The immaculate Grandeur broods upon your days, / Almighty powers are shut in Nature’s cells.

04.03_098:011 - A greater destiny waits you in your front: / This transient earthly being if he wills / Can fit his acts to a transcendent scheme.

04.03_098:012 - He who now stares at the world with ignorant eyes / Hardly from the Inconscient’s night aroused / That look at images and not at Truth / Can fill those orbs with an immortal’s sight.

04.03_098:013 - Yet shall the godhead grow within your hearts, / You shall awake into the spirit’s air / And feel the breaking walls of mortal mind / And hear the message which left life’s heart dumb / And look through Nature with sun-gazing lids / And blow your conch-shells at the Eternal’s gate.

04.03_098:014 - Authors of earth’s high change, to you it is given / To cross the dangerous spaces of the soul / And touch the mighty Mother stark awake / And meet the Omnipotent in this house of flesh / And make of life the million-bodied One.

04.03_098:015 - The earth you tread is a border screened from heaven, / The life you lead conceals the light you are.

04.03_098:016 - Immortal Powers sweep flaming past your doors; / Far-off upon your tops the god-chant sounds / While to exceed yourselves thought’s trumpets call, / Heard by a few, but fewer dare aspire, / The nympholepts of the ecstasy and the blaze.

04.03_098:017 - An epic of hope and failure breaks earth’s heart; / Her force and will exceed her form and fate.

04.03_098:018 - A goddess in a net of inconscience caught, / Self-bound in the pastures of death she dreams of life, / Self-racked with the pains of hell aspires to joy, / And builds to hope her altars of despair, / Knows that one high step might enfranchise all / And, suffering, looks for greatness in her sons.

04.03_098:019 - But dim in human hearts the ascending fire, / The invisible Grandeur sits unworshipped there; / Man sees the Highest in a limiting form / Or looks upon a Person, hears a Name.

04.03_098:020 - He turns for little gains to ignorant Powers / Or kindles his altar lights to a demon face.

04.03_098:021 - He loves the Ignorance fathering his pain.

04.03_098:022 - A spell is laid upon his glorious strengths.

04.03_098:023 - He has lost the inner Voice that led his thoughts, / And masking the oracular tripod seat / A specious Idol fills the marvel shrine.

04.03_098:024 - The great Illusion wraps him in its veils, / The soul’s deep intimations come in vain, / In vain is the unending line of seers, / The sages ponder in unsubstantial light, / The poets lend their voice to outward dreams, / A homeless fire inspires the prophet tongues.

04.03_098:025 - Heaven’s flaming lights descend and back return, / The luminous Eye approaches and retires; / Eternity speaks, none understands its word; / Fate is unwilling and the Abyss denies; / The Inconscient’s mindless waters block all done.

04.03_098:026 - Only a little lifted is Mind’s screen.

04.03_098:027 - The Wise who know see but one half of Truth, / The strong climb hardly to a low-peaked height, / The hearts that yearn are given one hour to love, / His tale half-told, falters the secret Bard; / The gods are still too few in mortal forms.”

04.03_098:028 - The Voice withdrew into its hidden skies.

04.03_098:029 - But like a shining answer from the gods / Approached through sun-bright spaces Savitri.

04.03_098:030 - Advancing amid tall heaven-pillaring trees, / Apparelled in her flickering-coloured robe, / She seemed burning towards the eternal realms / A bright moved torch of incense and of flame / That from the sky-roofed temple-soil of earth / A pilgrim hand lifts in an invisible shrine.

04.03_098:031 - There came the gift of a revealing hour: / He saw through depths that reinterpret all, / Limited not now by the dull body’s eyes, / New-found through an arch of clear discovery, / This intimation of the world’s delight, / This wonder of the divine Artist’s make / Carved like a nectar-cup for thirsty gods, / This breathing Scripture of the Eternal’s joy, / This net of sweetness woven of aureate fire.

04.03_098:032 - Transformed the delicate image-face became / A deeper Nature’s self-revealing sign, / A gold-leaf palimpsest of sacred births, / A grave world-symbol chiselled out of life.

04.03_098:033 - Her brow, a copy of clear unstained heavens, / Was meditation’s pedestal and defence, / The very room and smile of musing Space, / Its brooding line infinity’s symbol curve.

04.03_098:034 - Amid her tresses’ cloudy multitude / The long eyes shadowed as by wings of Night / Under that moon-gold forehead’s dreaming breadth / Were seas of love and thought that held the world; / Marvelling at life and earth they saw truths far.

04.03_098:035 - A deathless meaning filled her mortal limbs; / As in a golden vase’s poignant line / They seemed to carry the rhythmic sob of bliss / Of earth’s mute adoration towards heaven / Released in beauty’s cry of living form / Towards the perfection of eternal things.

04.03_098:036 - Transparent grown the ephemeral living dress / Bared the expressive deity to his view.

04.03_098:037 - Escaped from surface sight and mortal sense / The seizing harmony of its shapes became / The strange significant icon of a Power / Renewing its inscrutable descent / Into a human figure of its works / That stood out in life’s bold abrupt relief / On the soil of the evolving universe, / A godhead sculptured on a wall of thought, / Mirrored in the flowing hours and dimly shrined / In Matter as in a cathedral cave. #favorite

04.03_098:038 - Annulled were the transient values of the mind, / The body’s sense renounced its earthly look, / Immortal met immortal in their gaze.

04.03_098:039 - Awaked from the close spell of daily use / That hides soul-truth with the outward form’s disguise, / He saw through the familiar cherished limbs / The great and unknown spirit born his child.

04.03_098:040 - An impromptu from the deeper sight within, / Thoughts rose in him that knew not their own scope.

04.03_098:041 - Then to those large and brooding depths whence Love / Regarded him across the straits of mind, / He spoke in sentences from the unseen Heights.

04.03_098:042 - A casual passing phrase can change our life.

04.03_098:043 - For the hidden prompters of our speech sometimes / Can use the formulas of a moment’s mood / To weigh unconscious lips with words from Fate.

04.03_098:044 - “O Spirit, traveller of eternity, / Who camest from the immortal spaces here / Armed for the splendid hazard of thy life / To set thy conquering foot on Chance and Time, / The moon shut in her halo dreams like thee.

04.03_098:045 - A mighty Presence still defends thy frame.

04.03_098:046 - Perhaps the heavens guard thee for some great soul, / Thy fate, thy work are kept somewhere afar, / Thy spirit came not down a star alone.

04.03_098:047 - O living inscription of the beauty of love / Missalled in aureate virginity, / What message of heavenly strength and bliss in thee / Is written with the Eternal’s sun-white script, / One shall discover and greaten with it his life / To whom thou loosenest thy heart’s jewelled strings.

04.03_098:048 - O rubies of silence, lips from which there stole / Low laughter, music of tranquillity, / Star-lustrous eyes awake in sweet large night / And limbs like fine-linked poems made of gold / Stanzaed to glimmering curves by artist gods, / Depart where love and destiny call your charm.

04.03_098:049 - Venture through the deep world to find thy mate.

04.03_098:050 - For somewhere on the longing breast of earth, / Thy unknown lover waits for thee the unknown.

04.03_098:051 - Thy soul has strength and needs no other guide / Than One who burns within thy bosom’s powers.

04.03_098:052 - There shall draw near to meet thy approaching steps / The second self for whom thy nature asks, / He who shall walk until thy body’s end / A close-bound traveller pacing with thy pace, / The lyrist of thy soul’s most intimate chords / Who shall give voice to what in thee is mute.

04.03_098:053 - Then shall you grow like vibrant kindred harps, / One in the beats of difference and delight, / Responsive in divine and equal strains, / Discovering new notes of the eternal theme.

04.03_098:054 - One force shall be your mover and your guide, / One light shall be around you and within; / Hand in strong hand confront Heaven’s question, life: / Challenge the ordeal of the immense disguise.

04.03_098:055 - Ascend from Nature to divinity’s heights; / Face the high gods, crowned with felicity, / Then meet a greater God, thy self beyond Time.”

04.03_098:056 - This word was seed of all the thing to be.

04.03_098:057 - A hand from some Greatness opened her heart’s locked doors / And showed the work for which her strength was born.

04.03_098:058C - As when the mantra sinks in Yoga’s ear, / Its message enters stirring the blind brain / And keeps in the dim ignorant cells its sound; / The hearer understands a form of words / And, musing on the index thought it holds, / He strives to read it with the labouring mind, / But finds bright hints, not the embodied truth: / Then, falling silent in himself to know / He meets the deeper listening of his soul: / The Word repeats itself in rhythmic strains: / Thought, vision, feeling, sense, the body’s self / Are seized unalterably and he endures / An ecstasy and an immortal change; / He feels a Wideness and becomes a Power, / All knowledge rushes on him like a sea: / Transmuted by the white spiritual ray / He walks in naked heavens of joy and calm, / Sees the God-face and hears transcendent speech: / An equal greatness in her life was sown.

04.03_098:059 - Accustomed scenes were now an ended play.

04.03_098:060 - Moving in muse amid familiar powers, / Touched by new magnitudes and faery signs, / She turned to vastnesses not yet her own; / Allured her heart throbbed to unknown sweetnesses, / The secrets of an unseen world were close.

04.03_098:061 - The morn went up into a smiling sky; / Cast from its sapphire pinnacle of trance / Day sank into the burning gold of eve; / The moon floated, a luminous waif through heaven / And sank below the oblivious edge of dream; / Night lit the watch fires of eternity.

04.03_098:062 - Then all went back into mind’s secret caves; / A darkness stooping on the heaven-bird’s wings / Sealed in her senses from external sight / And opened the stupendous depths of sleep.

04.03_098:063 - When the pale dawn slipped through Night’s shadowy guard, / Vainly the new-born light desired her face; / The palace woke to its own emptiness; / The sovereign of its daily joys was far; / Her moonbeam feet tinged not the lucent floors: / The beauty and divinity were gone.

04.03_098:064 - Delight had fled to search the spacious world.


Canto 4 - 4.4: The Quest

Section I - 99: her golden chariot


04.04_099:001 - The world-ways opened before Savitri.

04.04_099:002 - At first a strangeness of new brilliant scenes / Peopled her mind and kept her body’s gaze.

04.04_099:003 - But as she moved across the changing earth / A deeper consciousness welled up in her: / A citizen of many scenes and climes, / Each soil and country it has made its home; / It took all clans and peoples for her own, / Till the whole destiny of mankind was hers.

04.04_099:004 - These unfamiliar spaces on her way / Were known and neighbours to a sense within; / Landscapes recurred like lost forgotten fields, / Cities and rivers and plains her vision claimed / Like slow-recurring memories in front, / The stars at night were her past’s brilliant friends, / The winds murmured to her of ancient things / And she met nameless comrades loved by her once.

04.04_099:005 - All was a part of old forgotten selves.

04.04_099:006 - Vaguely or with a flash of sudden hints / Her acts recalled a line of bygone power, / Even her motion’s purpose was not new: / Traveller to a prefigured high event, / She seemed to her remembering witness soul / To trace again a journey often made.

04.04_099:007 - A guidance turned the dumb revolving wheels / And in the eager body of their speed / The dim-masked hooded godheads rode who move / Assigned to man immutably from his birth, / Receivers of the inner and outer law, / At once the agents of his spirit’s will / And witnesses and executors of his fate.

04.04_099:008 - Inexorably faithful to their task, / They hold his nature’s sequence in their guard / Carrying the unbroken thread old lives have spun.

04.04_099:009 - Attendants on his destiny’s measured walk / Leading to joys he has won and pains he has called, / Even in his casual steps they intervene.

04.04_099:010 - Nothing we think or do is void or vain; / Each is an energy loosed and holds its course.

04.04_099:011 - The shadowy keepers of our deathless past / Have made our fate the child of our own acts, / And from the furrows laboured by our will / We reap the fruit of our forgotten deeds.

04.04_099:012 - But since unseen the tree that bore this fruit / And we live in a present born from an unknown past, / They seem but parts of a mechanic Force, / To a mechanic mind tied by earth’s laws; / Yet are they instruments of a Will supreme, / Watched by a still all-seeing Eye above.

04.04_099:013 - A prescient architect of Fate and Chance / Who builds our lives on a foreseen design / The meaning knows and consequence of each step / And watches the inferior stumbling powers.

04.04_099:014 - Upon her silent heights she was aware / Of a calm Presence throned above her brows / Who saw the goal and chose each fateful curve; / It used the body for its pedestal, / The eyes that wandered were its searchlight fires, / The hands that held the reins its living tools; / All was the working of an ancient plan, / A way prepared by an unerring Guide.

04.04_099:015 - Across wide noons and glowing afternoons, / She met with Nature and with human forms / And listened to the voices of the world; / Driven from within she followed her long road, / Mute in the luminous cavern of her heart, / Like a bright cloud through the resplendent day.

04.04_099:016 - At first her path ran far through peopled tracts: / Admitted to the lion eye of States / And theatres of the loud act of man, / Her carven chariot with its fretted wheels / Threaded through clamorous marts and sentinel towers / Past figured gates and high dream-sculptured fronts / And gardens hung in the sapphire of the skies, / Pillared assembly halls with armoured guards, / Small fanes where one calm Image watched man’s life / And temples hewn as if by exiled gods / To imitate their lost eternity.

04.04_099:017 - Often from gilded dusk to argent dawn / Where jewel-lamps flickered on frescoed walls / And the stone lattice stared at moonlit boughs, / Half-conscious of the tardy listening night / Dimly she glided between banks of sleep / At rest in the slumbering palaces of kings.

04.04_099:018 - Hamlet and village saw the fate-van pass, / Homes of a life bent to the soil it ploughs / For sustenance of its short and passing days / That, transient, keep their old repeated course / Unchanging in the circle of a sky / Which alters not above our mortal toil.

04.04_099:019 - Away from this thinking creature’s burdened hours / To free and griefless spaces now she turned / Not yet perturbed by human joys and fears.

04.04_099:020 - Here was the childhood of primeval earth, / Here timeless musings large and glad and still, / Men had forborne as yet to fill with cares, / Imperial acres of the eternal sower / And wind-stirred grass-lands winking in the sun: / Or mid green musing of woods and rough-browed hills, / In the grove’s murmurous bee-air humming wild / Or past the long lapsing voice of silver floods / Like a swift hope journeying among its dreams / Hastened the chariot of the golden bride.

04.04_099:021 - Out of the world’s immense unhuman past / Tract-memories and ageless remnants came, / Domains of light enfeoffed to an antique calm / Listened to the unaccustomed sound of hooves / And large immune entangled silences / Absorbed her into emerald secrecy / And slow hushed wizard nets of faery bloom / Environed with their coloured snare her wheels.

04.04_099:022 - The strong importunate feet of Time fell soft / Along these lonely ways, his titan pace / Forgotten and his stark and ruinous rounds.

04.04_099:023 - The inner ear that listens to solitude, / Leaning self-rapt unboundedly could hear / The rhythm of the intenser wordless Thought / That gathers in the silence behind life, / And the low sweet inarticulate voice of earth / In the great passion of her sun-kissed trance / Ascended with its yearning undertone.

04.04_099:024 - Afar from the brute noise of clamorous needs / The quieted all-seeking mind could feel, / At rest from its blind outwardness of will, / The unwearied clasp of her mute patient love / And know for a soul the mother of our forms.

04.04_099:025 - This spirit stumbling in the fields of sense, / This creature bruised in the mortar of the days / Could find in her broad spaces of release.

04.04_099:026 - Not yet was a world all occupied by care.

04.04_099:027 - The bosom of our mother kept for us still / Her austere regions and her musing depths, / Her impersonal reaches lonely and inspired / And the mightinesses of her rapture haunts.

04.04_099:028 - Muse-lipped she nursed her symbol mysteries / And guarded for her pure-eyed sacraments / The valley-clefts between her breasts of joy, / Her mountain-altars for the fires of dawn / And nuptial beaches where the ocean couched / And the huge chanting of her prophet woods.

04.04_099:029 - Fields had she of her solitary mirth, / Plains hushed and happy in the embrace of light, / Alone with the cry of birds and hue of flowers / And wildernesses of wonder lit by her moons / And grey seer-evenings kindling with the stars / And dim movement in the night’s infinitude.

04.04_099:030 - August, exulting in her Maker’s eye, / She felt her nearness to him in earth’s breast, / Conversed still with a Light behind the veil, / Still communed with Eternity beyond.

04.04_099:031 - A few and fit inhabitants she called / To share the glad communion of her peace; / The breadth, the summit were their natural home.

04.04_099:032 - The strong king-sages from their labour done, / Freed from the warrior tension of their task, / Came to her serene sessions in these wilds; / The strife was over, the respite lay in front.

04.04_099:033 - Happy they lived with birds and beasts and flowers / And sunlight and the rustle of the leaves, / And heard the wild winds wandering in the night, / Mused with the stars in their mute constant ranks, / And lodged in the mornings as in azure tents, / And with the glory of the noons were one.

04.04_099:034 - Some deeper plunged; from life’s external clasp / Beckoned into a fiery privacy / In the soul’s unassailed star-white recess / They sojourned with an ever-living Bliss; / A Voice profound in the ecstasy and the hush / They heard, beheld an all-revealing Light.

04.04_099:035 - All time-made difference they overcame; / The world was fibred with their own heart-strings; / Close-drawn to the heart that beats in every breast, / They reached the one self in all through boundless love.

04.04_099:036 - Attuned to Silence and to the world-rhyme, / They loosened the knot of the imprisoning mind; / Achieved was the wide untroubled witness gaze, / Unsealed was Nature’s great spiritual eye; / To the height of heights rose now their daily climb: / Truth leaned to them from her supernal realm; / Above them blazed eternity’s mystic suns.

04.04_099:037 - Nameless the austere ascetics without home / Abandoning speech and motion and desire, / Aloof from creatures sat absorbed, alone, / Immaculate in tranquil heights of self / On concentration’s luminous voiceless peaks, / World-naked hermits with their matted hair / Immobile as the passionless great hills / Around them grouped like thoughts of some vast mood / Awaiting the Infinite’s behest to end.

04.04_099:038 - The seers attuned to the universal Will, / Content in Him who smiles behind earth’s forms / Abode ungrieved by the insistent days.

04.04_099:039 - About them like green trees girdling a hill / Young grave disciples fashioned by their touch, / Trained to the simple act and conscious word, / Greatened within and grew to meet their heights.

04.04_099:040 - Far-wandering seekers on the Eternal’s path / Brought to these quiet founts their spirit’s thirst / And spent the treasure of a silent hour / Bathed in the purity of the mild gaze / That, uninsistent, ruled them from its peace, / And by its influence found the ways of calm.

04.04_099:041 - The Infants of the monarchy of the worlds, / The heroic leaders of a coming time, / King-children nurtured in that spacious air / Like lions gambolling in sky and sun / Received half-consciously their godlike stamp: / Formed in the type of the high thoughts they sang / They learned the wide magnificence of mood / That makes us comrades of the cosmic urge, / No longer chained to their small separate selves, / Plastic and firm beneath the eternal hand, / Met Nature with a bold and friendly clasp / And served in her the Power that shapes her works.

04.04_099:042 - One-souled to all and free from narrowing bonds, / Large like a continent of warm sunshine / In wide equality’s impartial joy, / These sages breathed for God’s delight in things.

04.04_099:043 - Assisting the slow entries of the gods, / Sowing in young minds immortal thoughts they lived, / Taught the great Truth to which man’s race must rise / Or opened the gates of freedom to a few, / Imparting to our struggling world the Light / They breathed like spirits from Time’s dull yoke released, / Comrades and vessels of the cosmic Force, / Using a natural mastery like the sun’s: / Their speech, their silence was a help to earth.

04.04_099:044 - A magic happiness flowed from their touch; / Oneness was sovereign in that sylvan peace, / The wild beast joined in friendship with its prey, / Persuading the hatred and the strife to cease / The love that flows from the one Mother’s breast / Healed with their hearts the hard and wounded world.

04.04_099:045 - Others escaped from the confines of thought / To where Mind motionless sleeps waiting Light’s birth, / And came back quivering with a nameless Force / Drunk with a wine of lightning in their cells; / Intuitive knowledge leaping into speech, / Hearing the subtle voice that clothes the heavens, / Carrying the splendour that has lit the suns, / They sang Infinity’s names and deathless powers / In metres that reflect the moving worlds, / Sight’s sound-waves breaking from the soul’s great deeps.

04.04_099:046 - Some lost to the person and his strip of thought / In a motionless ocean of impersonal Power, / Sat mighty, visioned with the Infinite’s Light, / Or, comrades of the everlasting Will, / Surveyed the plan of past and future Time.

04.04_099:047 - Some winged like birds out of the cosmic sea / And vanished into a bright and featureless Vast: / Some silent watched the universal dance, / Or helped the world by world-indifference.

04.04_099:048 - Some watched no more merged in a lonely Self, / Absorbed in the trance from which no soul returns, / All the occult world-lines for ever closed, / The chains of birth and person cast away: / Some uncompanioned reached the Ineffable.


Section I - 100: masked divinities doors


04.04_100:001 - As floats a sunbeam through a shady place, / The golden virgin in her carven car / Came gliding among meditation’s seats.

04.04_100:002 - Often in twilight mid returning troops / Of cattle thickening with their dust the shades / When the loud day had slipped below the verge, / Arriving in a peaceful hermit grove / She rested drawing round her like a cloak / Its spirit of patient muse and potent prayer.

04.04_100:003 - Or near to a lion river’s tawny mane / And trees that worshipped on a praying shore, / A domed and templed air’s serene repose / Beckoned to her hurrying wheels to stay their speed.

04.04_100:004 - In the solemnity of a space that seemed / A mind remembering ancient silences, / Where to the heart great bygone voices called / And the large liberty of brooding seers / Had left the long impress of their soul’s scene / Awake in candid dawn or darkness mooned, / To the still touch inclined the daughter of Flame / Drank in hushed splendour between tranquil lids / And felt the kinship of eternal calm.

04.04_100:005 - But morn broke in reminding her of her quest / And from low rustic couch or mat she rose / And went impelled on her unfinished way / And followed the fateful orbit of her life / Like a desire that questions silent gods, / Then passes starlike to some bright Beyond.

04.04_100:006 - Thence to great solitary tracts she came, / Where man was a passer-by towards human scenes / Or sole in Nature’s vastness strove to live / And called for help to ensouled invisible Powers, / Overwhelmed by the immensity of his world / And unaware of his own infinity.

04.04_100:007 - The Earth multiplied to her a changing brow / And called her with a far and nameless voice.

04.04_100:008 - The mountains in their anchorite solitude, / The forests with their multitudinous chant / Disclosed to her the masked divinity’s doors.

04.04_100:009 - On dreaming plains, an indolent expanse, / The death-bed of a pale enchanted eve / Under the glamour of a sunken sky, / Impassive she lay as at an age’s end, / Or crossed an eager pack of huddled hills / Lifting their heads to hunt a lairlike sky, / Or travelled in a strange and empty land / Where desolate summits camped in a weird heaven, / Mute sentinels beneath a drifting moon, / Or wandered in some lone tremendous wood / Ringing for ever with the crickets’ cry, / Or followed a long glistening serpent road / Through fields and pastures lapped in moveless light / Or reached the wild beauty of a desert space / Where never plough was driven nor herd had grazed / And slumbered upon stripped and thirsty sands / Amid the savage wild-beast Night’s appeal.

04.04_100:010 - Still unaccomplished was the fateful quest; / Still she found not the one predestined face / For which she sought amid the sons of men.

04.04_100:011 - A grandiose silence wrapped the regal day.

04.04_100:012 - The months had fed the passion of the sun / And now his burning breath assailed the soil.

04.04_100:013 - The tiger heats prowled through the fainting earth; / All was licked up as by a lolling tongue.

04.04_100:014 - The spring winds failed; the sky was set like bronze.


Canto Book5 - 5: THE BOOK OF LOVE

Canto 1 - 5.1: The Destined Meeting-Place

Section I - 101: meeting-place


05.01_101:001 - But now the destined spot and hour were close; / Unknowing she had neared her nameless goal.

05.01_101:002 - For though a dress of blind and devious chance / Is laid upon the work of all-wise Fate, / Our acts interpret an omniscient Force / That dwells in the compelling stuff of things, / And nothing happens in the cosmic play / But at its time and in its foreseen place.

05.01_101:003 - To a space she came of soft and delicate air / That seemed a sanctuary of youth and joy, / A highland world of free and green delight / Where spring and summer lay together and strove / In indolent and amicable debate, / Inarmed, disputing with laughter who should rule.

05.01_101:004 - There expectation beat wide sudden wings, / As if a soul had looked out from earth’s face / And all that was in her felt a coming change / And forgetting obvious joys and common dreams, / Obedient to Time’s call and the spirit’s fate, / Were lifted to a beauty calm and pure / That lived under the eyes of Eternity.

05.01_101:005 - A crowd of mountainous heads assailed the sky / Pushing towards rival shoulders nearer heaven, / The armoured leaders of an iron line; / Earth prostrate lay beneath their feet of stone.

05.01_101:006 - Below there crouched a dream of emerald woods / And gleaming borders solitary as sleep: / Pale waters ran like glimmering threads of pearl.

05.01_101:007 - A sigh was straying among happy leaves; / Cool-perfumed with slow pleasure-burdened feet / Faint stumbling breezes faltered among flowers.

05.01_101:008 - The white crane stood, a vivid motionless streak, / Peacock and parrot jewelled soil and tree, / The dove’s soft moan enriched the enamoured air / And fire-winged wild-drakes swam in silvery pools.

05.01_101:009 - Earth couched alone with her great lover Heaven, / Uncovered to her consort’s purple eye.

05.01_101:010 - In her luxurious ecstasy of joy / She squandered the love-music of her notes, / Wasted the passionate pattern of her blooms / And festival riot of her scents and hues.

05.01_101:011 - A cry and leap and hurry were around, / The stealthy footfalls of her chasing things, / The shaggy emerald of her centaur mane, / The gold and sapphire of her warmth and blaze.

05.01_101:012 - Magician of her rapt felicities, / Blithe, sensuous-hearted, careless and divine, / Life ran or hid in her delightful rooms; / Behind all brooded Nature’s grandiose calm.

05.01_101:013 - Primeval peace was there and in its bosom / Held undisturbed the strife of bird and beast.

05.01_101:014 - Man, the deep-browed artificer, had not come / To lay his hand on happy inconscient things, / Thought was not there nor the measurer, strong-eyed toil, / Life had not learned its discord with its aim.

05.01_101:015 - The mighty Mother lay outstretched at ease.

05.01_101:016 - All was in line with her first satisfied plan; / Moved by a universal will of joy / The trees bloomed in their green felicity / And the wild children brooded not on pain.

05.01_101:017 - At the end reclined a stern and giant tract / Of tangled depths and solemn questioning hills / And peaks like a bare austerity of the soul, / Armoured, remote and desolately grand / Like the thought-screened infinities that lie / Behind the rapt smile of the Almighty’s dance.

05.01_101:018 - A matted forest-head invaded heaven / As if a blue-throated ascetic peered / From the stone fastness of his mountain cell / Regarding the brief gladness of the days; / His vast extended spirit couched behind.

05.01_101:019 - A mighty murmur of immense retreat / Besieged the ear, a sad and limitless call / As of a soul retiring from the world.

05.01_101:020 - This was the scene which the ambiguous Mother / Had chosen for her brief felicitous hour; / Here in this solitude far from the world / Her part she began in the world’s joy and strife.

05.01_101:021 - Here were disclosed to her the mystic courts, / The lurking doors of beauty and surprise, / The wings that murmur in the golden house, / The temple of sweetness and the fiery aisle.

05.01_101:022 - A stranger on the sorrowful roads of Time, / Immortal under the yoke of death and fate, / A sacrificant of the bliss and pain of the spheres, / Love in the wilderness met Savitri.


Canto 2 - 5.2: Satyavan

Section I - 102: map of Self and God


05.02_102:001 - All she remembered on this day of Fate, / The road that hazarded not the solemn depths / But turned away to flee to human homes, / The wilderness with its mighty monotone, / The morning like a lustrous seer above, / The passion of the summits lost in heaven, / The titan murmur of the endless woods.

05.02_102:002 - As if a wicket gate to joy were there / Ringed in with voiceless hint and magic sign, / Upon the margin of an unknown world / Reclined the curve of a sun-held recess; / Groves with strange flowers like eyes of gazing nymphs / Peered from their secrecy into open space, / Boughs whispering to a constancy of light / Sheltered a dim and screened felicity, / And slowly a supine inconstant breeze / Ran like a fleeting sigh of happiness / Over slumberous grasses pranked with green and gold.

05.02_102:003 - Hidden in the forest’s bosom of loneliness / Amid the leaves the inmate voices called, / Sweet like desires enamoured and unseen, / Cry answering to low insistent cry.

05.02_102:004 - Behind slept emerald dumb remotenesses, / Haunt of a Nature passionate, veiled, denied / To all but her own vision lost and wild.

05.02_102:005 - Earth in this beautiful refuge free from cares / Murmured to the soul a song of strength and peace.

05.02_102:006 - Only one sign was there of a human tread: / A single path, shot thin and arrowlike / Into this bosom of vast and secret life, / Pierced its enormous dream of solitude.

05.02_102:007 - Here first she met on the uncertain earth / The one for whom her heart had come so far.

05.02_102:008 - As might a soul on Nature’s background limned / Stand out for a moment in a house of dream / Created by the ardent breath of life, / So he appeared against the forest verge / Inset twixt green relief and golden ray.

05.02_102:009 - As if a weapon of the living Light, / Erect and lofty like a spear of God / His figure led the splendour of the morn.

05.02_102:010 - Noble and clear as the broad peaceful heavens / A tablet of young wisdom was his brow, / Freedom’s imperious beauty curved his limbs, / The joy of life was on his open face.

05.02_102:011 - His look was a wide daybreak of the gods, / His head was a youthful Rishi’s touched with light, / His body was a lover’s and a king’s.

05.02_102:012 - In the magnificent dawning of his force / Built like a moving statue of delight / He illumined the border of the forest page.

05.02_102:013 - Out of the ignorant eager toil of the years / Abandoning man’s loud drama he had come / Led by the wisdom of an adverse Fate / To meet the ancient Mother in her groves.

05.02_102:014 - In her divine communion he had grown / A foster-child of beauty and solitude, / Heir to the centuries of the lonely wise, / A brother of the sunshine and the sky, / A wanderer communing with depth and marge.

05.02_102:015 - A Veda-knower of the unwritten book / Perusing the mystic scripture of her forms / He had caught her hierophant significances, / Her sphered immense imaginations learned, / Taught by sublimities of stream and wood / And voices of the sun and star and flame / And chant of the magic singers on the boughs / And the dumb teaching of four-footed things.

05.02_102:016 - Helping with confident steps her slow great hands / He leaned to her influence like a flower to rain / And, like the flower and tree a natural growth, / Widened with the touches of her shaping hours.

05.02_102:017 - The mastery free natures have was his / And their assent to joy and spacious calm; / One with the single Spirit inhabiting all, / He laid experience at the Godhead’s feet; / His mind was open to her infinite mind, / His acts were rhythmic with her primal force; / He had subdued his mortal thought to hers.

05.02_102:018 - That day he had turned from his accustomed paths; / For One who, knowing every moment’s load, / Can move in all our studied or careless steps, / Had laid the spell of destiny on his feet / And drawn him to the forest’s flowering verge.

05.02_102:019 - At first her glance that took life’s million shapes / Impartially to people its treasure-house / Along with sky and flower and hill and star, / Dwelt rather on the bright harmonious scene.

05.02_102:020 - It saw the green gold of the slumbrous sward, / The grasses quivering with the slow wind’s tread, / The branches haunted by the wild bird’s call.

05.02_102:021 - Awake to Nature, vague as yet to life, / The eager prisoner from the Infinite, / The immortal wrestler in its mortal house, / Its pride, power, passion of a striving God, / It saw this image of veiled deity, / This thinking master creature of the earth, / This last result of the beauty of the stars, / But only saw like fair and common forms / The artist spirit needs not for its work / And puts aside in memory’s shadowy rooms.

05.02_102:022 - A look, a turn decides our ill-poised fate.

05.02_102:023 - Thus in the hour that most concerned her all, / Wandering unwarned by the slow surface mind, / The heedless scout beneath her tenting lids / Admired indifferent beauty and cared not / To wake her body’s spirit to its king.

05.02_102:024 - So might she have passed by on chance ignorant roads / Missing the call of Heaven, losing life’s aim, / But the god touched in time her conscious soul.

05.02_102:025 - Her vision settled, caught and all was changed.

05.02_102:026 - Her mind at first dwelt in ideal dreams, / Those intimate transmuters of earth’s signs / That make known things a hint of unseen spheres, / And saw in him the genius of the spot, / A symbol figure standing mid earth’s scenes, / A king of life outlined in delicate air.

05.02_102:027 - Yet this was but a moment’s reverie; / For suddenly her heart looked out at him, / The passionate seeing used thought cannot match, / And knew one nearer than its own close strings.

05.02_102:028 - All in a moment was surprised and seized, / All in inconscient ecstasy lain wrapped / Or under imagination’s coloured lids / Held up in a large mirror-air of dream, / Broke forth in flame to recreate the world, / And in that flame to new things she was born.

05.02_102:029 - A mystic tumult from her depths arose; / Hailed, smitten erect like one who dreamed at ease, / Life ran to gaze from every gate of sense: / Thoughts indistinct and glad in moon-mist heavens, / Feelings as when a universe takes birth, / Swept through the turmoil of her bosom’s space / Invaded by a swarm of golden gods: / Arising to a hymn of wonder’s priests / Her soul flung wide its doors to this new sun.

05.02_102:030 - An alchemy worked, the transmutation came; / The missioned face had wrought the Master’s spell.

05.02_102:031 - In the nameless light of two approaching eyes / A swift and fated turning of her days / Appeared and stretched to the gleam of unknown worlds.

05.02_102:032 - Then trembling with the mystic shock her heart / Moved in her breast and cried out like a bird / Who hears his mate upon a neighbouring bough.

05.02_102:033 - Hooves trampling fast, wheels largely stumbling ceased; / The chariot stood like an arrested wind.

05.02_102:034 - And Satyavan looked out from his soul’s doors / And felt the enchantment of her liquid voice / Fill his youth’s purple ambiance and endured / The haunting miracle of a perfect face.

05.02_102:035 - Mastered by the honey of a strange flower-mouth, / Drawn to soul-spaces opening round a brow, / He turned to the vision like a sea to the moon / And suffered a dream of beauty and of change, / Discovered the aureole round a mortal’s head, / Adored a new divinity in things.

05.02_102:036 - His self-bound nature foundered as in fire; / His life was taken into another’s life.

05.02_102:037 - The splendid lonely idols of his brain / Fell prostrate from their bright sufficiencies, / As at the touch of a new infinite, / To worship a godhead greater than their own.

05.02_102:038 - An unknown imperious force drew him to her.

05.02_102:039 - Marvelling he came across the golden sward: / Gaze met close gaze and clung in sight’s embrace.

05.02_102:040 - A visage was there, noble and great and calm, / As if encircled by a halo of thought, / A span, an arch of meditating light, / As though some secret nimbus half was seen; / Her inner vision still remembering knew / A forehead that wore the crown of all her past, / Two eyes her constant and eternal stars, / Comrade and sovereign eyes that claimed her soul, / Lids known through many lives, large frames of love.

05.02_102:041 - He met in her regard his future’s gaze, / A promise and a presence and a fire, / Saw an embodiment of aeonic dreams, / A mystery of the rapture for which all / Yearns in this world of brief mortality / Made in material shape his very own.

05.02_102:042 - This golden figure given to his grasp / Hid in its breast the key of all his aims, / A spell to bring the Immortal’s bliss on earth, / To mate with heaven’s truth our mortal thought, / To lift earth-hearts nearer the Eternal’s sun.

05.02_102:043 - In these great spirits now incarnate here / Love brought down power out of eternity / To make of life his new undying base.

05.02_102:044 - His passion surged a wave from fathomless deeps; / It leapt to earth from far forgotten heights, / But kept its nature of infinity.

05.02_102:045 - On the dumb bosom of this oblivious globe / Although as unknown beings we seem to meet, / Our lives are not aliens nor as strangers join, / Moved to each other by a causeless force.

05.02_102:046 - The soul can recognise its answering soul / Across dividing Time and, on Life’s roads / Absorbed wrapped traveller, turning it recovers / Familiar splendours in an unknown face / And touched by the warning finger of swift love / It thrills again to an immortal joy / Wearing a mortal body for delight.

05.02_102:047 - There is a Power within that knows beyond / Our knowings; we are greater than our thoughts, / And sometimes earth unveils that vision here.

05.02_102:048 - To live, to love are signs of infinite things, / Love is a glory from eternity’s spheres.

05.02_102:049 - Abased, disfigured, mocked by baser mights / That steal his name and shape and ecstasy, / He is still the Godhead by which all can change.

05.02_102:050 - A mystery wakes in our inconscient stuff, / A bliss is born that can remake our life.

05.02_102:051 - Love dwells in us like an unopened flower / Awaiting a rapid moment of the soul, / Or he roams in his charmed sleep mid thoughts and things; / The child-god is at play, he seeks himself / In many hearts and minds and living forms: / He lingers for a sign that he can know / And, when it comes, wakes blindly to a voice, / A look, a touch, the meaning of a face.

05.02_102:052 - His instrument the dim corporeal mind, / Of celestial insight now forgetful grown, / He seizes on some sign of outward charm / To guide him mid the throng of Nature’s hints, / Reads heavenly truths into earth’s semblances, / Desires the image for the Godhead’s sake, / Divines the immortalities of form / And takes the body for the sculptured soul.

05.02_102:053A - Love’s adoration like a mystic seer / Through vision looks at the invisible, / In earth’s alphabet finds a God-like sense; / But the mind only thinks, “Behold the one / For whom my life has waited long unfilled, / Behold the sudden sovereign of my days.”

05.02_102:054 - Heart feels for heart, limb cries for answering limb; / All strives to enforce the unity all is.

05.02_102:055 - Too far from the Divine, Love seeks his truth / And life is blind and the instruments deceive / And Powers are there that labour to debase.

05.02_102:056 - Still can the vision come, the joy arrive.

05.02_102:057 - Rare is the cup fit for love’s nectar wine, / As rare the vessel that can hold God’s birth; / A soul made ready through a thousand years / Is the living mould of a supreme Descent.

05.02_102:058 - These knew each other though in forms thus strange.

05.02_102:059 - Although to sight unknown, although life, mind / Had altered to hold a new significance, / These bodies summed the drift of numberless births / And the spirit to the spirit was the same.

05.02_102:060 - Amazed by a joy for which they had waited long, / The lovers met upon their different paths, / Travellers across the limitless plains of Time / Together drawn from fate-led journeyings / In the self-closed solitude of their human past, / To a swift rapturous dream of future joy / And the unexpected present of these eyes.

05.02_102:061 - By the revealing greatness of a look, / Form-smitten the spirit’s memory woke in sense.

05.02_102:062 - The mist was torn that lay between two lives; / Her heart unveiled and his to find her turned; / Attracted as in heaven star by star, / They wondered at each other and rejoiced / And wove affinity in a silent gaze.

05.02_102:063 - A moment passed that was eternity’s ray, / An hour began, the matrix of new Time.


Canto 3 - 5.3: Satyavan and Savitri

Section I - 103: thou hast come and all will surely change


05.03_103:001 - Out of the voiceless mystery of the past / In a present ignorant of forgotten bonds / These spirits met upon the roads of Time.

05.03_103:002 - Yet in the heart their secret conscious selves / At once aware grew of each other warned / By the first call of a delightful voice / And a first vision of the destined face.

05.03_103:003 - As when being cries to being from its depths / Behind the screen of the external sense / And strives to find the heart-disclosing word, / The passionate speech revealing the soul’s need, / But the mind’s ignorance veils the inner sight, / Only a little breaks through our earth-made bounds, / So now they met in that momentous hour, / So utter the recognition in the deeps, / The remembrance lost, the oneness felt and missed.

05.03_103:004 - Thus Satyavan spoke first to Savitri: / “O thou who com’st to me out of Time’s silences, / Yet thy voice has wakened my heart to an unknown bliss, / Immortal or mortal only in thy frame, / For more than earth speaks to me from thy soul / And more than earth surrounds me in thy gaze, / How art thou named among the sons of men?

05.03_103:005 - Whence hast thou dawned filling my spirit’s days, / Brighter than summer, brighter than my flowers, / Into the lonely borders of my life, / O Sunlight moulded like a golden maid?

05.03_103:006 - I know that mighty gods are friends of earth.

05.03_103:007 - Amid the pageantries of day and dusk, / Long have I travelled with my pilgrim soul / Moved by the marvel of familiar things.

05.03_103:008 - Earth could not hide from me the powers she veils: / Even though moving mid an earthly scene / And the common surfaces of terrestrial things, / My vision saw unblinded by her forms; / The Godhead looked at me from familiar scenes.

05.03_103:009 - I witnessed the virgin bridals of the dawn / Behind the glowing curtains of the sky / Or vying in joy with the bright morning’s steps / I paced along the slumberous coasts of morn, / Or the gold desert of the sunlight crossed / Traversing great wastes of splendour and of fire, / Or met the moon gliding amazed through heaven / In the uncertain wideness of the night, / Or the stars marched on their long sentinel routes / Pointing their spears through the infinitudes, / The day and dusk revealed to me hidden shapes; / Figures have come to me from secret shores / And happy faces looked from ray and flame.

05.03_103:010 - I have heard strange voices cross the ether’s waves, / The centaur’s wizard song has thrilled my ear; / I glimpsed the Apsaras bathing in the pools / And saw the wood-nymphs peering through the leaves; / The winds have shown to me their trampling lords, / I have beheld the princes of the Sun / Burning in thousand-pillared homes of light.

05.03_103:011 - So now my mind could dream and my heart fear / That from some wonder-couch beyond our air / Risen in a wide morning of the gods / Thou drov’st thy horses from the Thunderer’s worlds.

05.03_103:012 - Although to heaven thy beauty seems allied, / Much rather would my thoughts rejoice to know / That mortal sweetness smiles between thy lips / And thy heart can beat beneath a human gaze / And thy aureate bosom quiver with a look / And its tumult answer to an earth-born voice.

05.03_103:013 - If our time-vexed affections thou canst feel, / Earth’s ease of simple things can satisfy, / If thy glance can dwell content on earthly soil, / And this celestial summary of delight, / Thy golden body, dally with fatigue / Oppressing with its grace our terrain, while / The frail sweet passing taste of earthly food / Delays thee and the torrent’s leaping wine, / Descend. Let thy journey cease, come down to us.

05.03_103:014 - Close is my father’s creepered hermitage / Screened by the tall ranks of these silent kings, / Sung to by voices of the hue-robed choirs / Whose chants repeat transcribed in music’s notes / The passionate coloured lettering of the boughs / And fill the hours with their melodious cry.

05.03_103:015 - Amid the welcome-hum of many bees / Invade our honied kingdom of the woods; / There let me lead thee into an opulent life.

05.03_103:016 - Bare, simple is the sylvan hermit-life; / Yet is it clad with the jewelry of earth.

05.03_103:017 - Wild winds run—visitors midst the swaying tops, / Through the calm days heaven’s sentinels of peace / Couched on a purple robe of sky above / Look down on a rich secrecy and hush / And the chambered nuptial waters chant within.

05.03_103:018 - Enormous, whispering, many-formed around / High forest gods have taken in their arms / The human hour, a guest of their centuried pomps.

05.03_103:019 - Apparelled are the morns in gold and green, / Sunlight and shadow tapestry the walls / To make a resting chamber fit for thee.”

05.03_103:020 - Awhile she paused as if hearing still his voice, / Unwilling to break the charm, then slowly spoke.

05.03_103:021 - Musing she answered: “I am Savitri, / Princess of Madra. Who art thou? What name / Musical on earth expresses thee to men?

05.03_103:022 - What trunk of kings watered by fortunate streams / Has flowered at last upon one happy branch?

05.03_103:023 - Why is thy dwelling in the pathless wood / Far from the deeds thy glorious youth demands, / Haunt of the anchorites and earth’s wilder broods, / Where only with thy witness self thou roam’st / In Nature’s green unhuman loneliness / Surrounded by enormous silences / And the blind murmur of primeval calms?”

05.03_103:024 - And Satyavan replied to Savitri: / “In days when yet his sight looked clear on life, / King Dyumathsena once, the Shalwa, reigned / Through all the tract which from behind these tops / Passing its days of emerald delight / In trusting converse with the traveller winds / Turns, looking back towards the southern heavens / And leans its flank upon the musing hills.

05.03_103:025 - But equal fate removed her covering hand, / A living night enclosed the strong man’s paths, / Heaven’s brilliant gods recalled their careless gifts, / Took from blank eyes their glad and helping ray / And led the uncertain goddess from his side.

05.03_103:026 - Outcast from empire of the outer light, / Lost to the comradeship of seeing men, / He sojourns in two solitudes, within / And in the solemn rustle of the woods.

05.03_103:027 - Son of that king, I, Satyavan, have lived / Contented, for not yet of thee aware, / In my high peopled loneliness of spirit / And this huge vital murmur kin to me, / Nursed by the vastness, pupil of solitude.

05.03_103:028 - Great Nature came to her recovered child; / I reigned in a kingdom of a nobler kind / Than men can build upon dull Matter’s soil; / I met the frankness of the primal earth, / I enjoyed the intimacy of infant God.

05.03_103:029 - In the great tapestried chambers of her state / Free in her boundless palace I have dwelt / Indulged by the warm mother of us all, / Reared with my natural brothers in her house / I lay in the wide bare embrace of heaven, / The sunlight’s radiant blessing clasped my brow, / The moonbeam’s silver ecstasy at night / Kissed my dim lids to sleep. Earth’s morns were mine; / Lured by faint murmurings with the green-robed hours / I wandered lost in woods, prone to the voice / Of winds and waters, partner of the sun’s joy, / A listener to the universal speech: / My spirit satisfied within me knew / Godlike our birthright, luxuried our life / Whose close belongings are the earth and skies.

05.03_103:030 - Before fate led me into this emerald world, / Aroused by some foreshadowing touch within, / An early prescience in my mind approached / The great dumb animal consciousness of earth / Now grown so close to me who have left old pomps / To live in this grandiose murmur dim and vast.

05.03_103:031 - As if to a deeper country of the soul / Transposing the vivid imagery of earth, / Through an inner seeing and sense a wakening came.

05.03_103:032 - A visioned spell pursued my boyhood’s hours, / All things the eye had caught in coloured lines / Were seen anew through the interpreting mind / And in the shape it sought to seize the soul.

05.03_103:033 - An early child-god took my hand that held, / Moved, guided by the seeking of his touch, / Bright forms and hues which fled across his sight; / Limned upon page and stone they spoke to men.

05.03_103:034 - High beauty’s visitants my inmates were.

05.03_103:035 - The neighing pride of rapid life that roams / Wind-maned through our pastures, on my seeing mood / Cast shapes of swiftness; trooping spotted deer / Against the vesper sky became a song / Of evening to the silence of the soul.

05.03_103:036 - I caught for some eternal eye the sudden / Kingfisher flashing to a darkling pool; / A slow swan silvering the azure lake, / A shape of magic whiteness, sailed through dream; / Leaves trembling with the passion of the wind / And wandering wings nearing from infinity / Lived on the tablets of my inner sight; / Mountains and trees stood there like thoughts from God.

05.03_103:037 - Pranked butterflies, the conscious flowers of air, / The brilliant long bills in their vivid dress, / The peacock scattering on the breeze his moons / Painted my memory like a frescoed wall.

05.03_103:038 - I carved my vision out of wood and stone; / I caught the echoes of a word supreme / And metred the rhythm beats of infinity / And listened through music for the eternal Voice.

05.03_103:039 - I felt a covert touch, I heard a call, / But could not clasp the body of my God / Or hold between my hands the World-Mother’s feet.

05.03_103:040 - In men I met strange portions of a Self / That sought for fragments and in fragments lived: / Each lived in himself and for himself alone / And with the rest joined only fleeting ties; / Each passioned over his surface joy and grief, / Nor saw the Eternal in his secret house.

05.03_103:041 - I conversed with Nature, mused with the changeless stars, / God’s watch-fires burning in the ignorant Night, / And saw upon her mighty visage fall / A ray prophetic of the Eternal’s sun.

05.03_103:042 - I sat with the forest sages in their trance: / There poured awaking streams of diamond light, / I glimpsed the presence of the One in all.

05.03_103:043 - But still there lacked the last transcendent power / And Matter still slept empty of its Lord.

05.03_103:044 - The spirit was saved, the body lost and mute / Lived still with Death and ancient Ignorance; / The Inconscient was its base, the Void its fate.

05.03_103:045t - But thou hast come and all will surely change: / I shall feel the World-Mother in thy golden limbs / And hear her wisdom in thy sacred voice. #divine-fate #divine-grace #divine-providence #divine-revelation #meaning-of-life #sacred-trust #truth-of-things

05.03_103:046 - The child of the Void shall be reborn in God.

05.03_103:047 - My Matter shall evade the Inconscient’s trance, / My body like my spirit shall be free: / It shall escape from Death and Ignorance.”

05.03_103:048 - And Savitri musing still replied to him: / “Speak more to me, speak more, O Satyavan, / Speak of thyself and all thou art within; / I would know thee as if we had ever lived / Together in the chamber of our souls.

05.03_103:049 - Speak till a light shall come into my heart / And my moved mortal mind shall understand / What all the deathless being in me feels.

05.03_103:050 - It knows that thou art he my spirit has sought / Amidst earth’s thronging visages and forms / Across the golden spaces of my life.”

05.03_103:051 - And Satyavan like a replying harp / To the insistent calling of a flute / Answered her questioning and let stream to her / His heart in many-coloured waves of speech: / “O golden princess, perfect Savitri, / More I would tell than failing words can speak / Of all that thou hast meant to me, unknown, / All that the lightning flash of love reveals.

05.03_103:052 - In one great hour of the unveiling gods / Even a brief nearness has reshaped my life.

05.03_103:053 - For now I know that all I lived and was / Moved towards this moment of my heart’s rebirth; / I look back on the meaning of myself, / A soul made ready on earth’s soil for thee.

05.03_103:054 - Once were my days like days of other men: / To think and act was all, to enjoy and breathe; / This was the width and height of mortal hope: / Yet there came glimpses of a deeper self / That lives behind life and makes her act its scene.

05.03_103:055 - A truth was felt that screened its shape from mind, / A Greatness working towards a hidden end, / And vaguely through the forms of earth there looked / Something that life is not and yet must be.

05.03_103:056 - I groped for the Mystery with the lantern, Thought.

05.03_103:057 - Its glimmerings lighted with the abstract word / A half-visible ground and travelling yard by yard / It mapped a system of the Self and God.

05.03_103:058 - I could not live the truth it spoke and thought.

05.03_103:059 - I turned to seize its form in visible things, / Hoping to fix its rule by mortal mind, / Imposed a narrow structure of world-law / Upon the freedom of the Infinite, / A hard firm skeleton of outward Truth, / A mental scheme of a mechanic Power.

05.03_103:060 - This light showed more the darknesses unsearched; / It made the original secrecy more occult.

05.03_103:061 - It could not analyse its cosmic veil / Or glimpse the Wonder-worker’s hidden hand / And trace the pattern of his magic plans.

05.03_103:062 - I plunged into an inner seeing Mind / And knew the secret laws and sorceries / That make of Matter mind’s bewildered slave.

05.03_103:063 - The mystery was not solved but deepened more.

05.03_103:064 - I strove to find its hints through Beauty and Art, / But Form cannot unveil the indwelling Power; / Only it throws its symbols at our hearts.

05.03_103:065 - It evoked a mood of self, invoked a sign / Of all the brooding glory hidden in sense: / I lived in the ray but faced not to the Sun.

05.03_103:066 - I looked upon the world and missed the Self, / And when I found the Self, I lost the world, / My other selves I lost and the body of God, / The link of the finite with the Infinite, / The bridge between the appearance and the Truth, / The mystic aim for which the world was made, / The human sense of Immortality.

05.03_103:067 - But now the gold link comes to me with thy feet / And His gold sun has shone on me from thy face.

05.03_103:068 - For now another realm draws near with thee / And now diviner voices fill my ear, / A strange new world swims to me in thy gaze / Approaching like a star from unknown heavens; / A cry of spheres comes with thee and a song / Of flaming gods. I draw a wealthier breath / And in a fierier march of moments move.

05.03_103:069 - My mind transfigures to a rapturous seer.

05.03_103:070 - A foam-leap travelling from the waves of bliss / Has changed my heart and changed the earth around: / All with thy coming fills. Air, soil and stream / Wear bridal raiment to be fit for thee / And sunlight grows a shadow of thy hue / Because of change within me by thy look.

05.03_103:071 - Come nearer to me from thy car of light / On this green sward disdaining not our soil.

05.03_103:072 - For here are secret spaces made for thee / Whose caves of emerald long to screen thy form.

05.03_103:073 - Wilt thou not make this mortal bliss thy sphere?

05.03_103:074 - Descend, O Happiness, with thy moon-gold feet, / Enrich earth’s floors upon whose sleep we lie.

05.03_103:075 - O my bright beauty’s princess, Savitri, / By my delight and thy own joy compelled / Enter my life, thy chamber and thy shrine.

05.03_103:076 - In the great quietness where spirits meet, / Led by my hushed desire into my woods / Let the dim rustling arches over thee lean; / One with the breath of things eternal live, / Thy heartbeats near to mine, till there shall leap / Enchanted from the fragrance of the flowers / A moment which all murmurs shall recall / And every bird remember in its cry.”


Section I - 104: he gathered all Savitri


05.03_104:001 - Allured to her lashes by his passionate words / Her fathomless soul looked at him from her eyes; / Passing her lips in liquid sounds it spoke.

05.03_104:002 - This word alone she uttered and said all: / “O Satyavan, I have heard thee and I know; / I know that thou and only thou art he.”

05.03_104:003 - Then down she came from her high carven car / Descending with a soft and faltering haste; / Her many-hued raiment glistening in the light / Hovered a moment over the wind-stirred grass, / Mixed with a glimmer of her body’s ray / Like lovely plumage of a settling bird.

05.03_104:004 - Her gleaming feet upon the green gold sward / Scattered a memory of wandering beams / And lightly pressed the unspoken desire of earth / Cherished in her too brief passing by the soil.

05.03_104:005 - Then flitting like pale brilliant moths her hands / Took from the sylvan verge’s sunlit arms / A load of their jewel faces’ clustering swarms, / Companions of the spring-time and the breeze.

05.03_104:006 - A candid garland set with simple forms / Her rapid fingers taught a flower song / The stanzaed movement of a marriage hymn.

05.03_104:007 - Profound in perfume and immersed in hue / They mixed their yearning’s coloured signs and made / The bloom of their purity and passion one.

05.03_104:008 - A sacrament of joy in treasuring palms / She brought, flower-symbol of her offered life, / Then with raised hands that trembled a little now / At the very closeness that her soul desired, / This bond of sweetness, their bright union’s sign, / She laid on the bosom coveted by her love.

05.03_104:009 - As if inclined before some gracious god / Who has out of his mist of greatness shone / To fill with beauty his adorer’s hours, / She bowed and touched his feet with worshipping hands; / She made her life his world for him to tread / And made her body the room of his delight, / Her beating heart a remembrancer of bliss.

05.03_104:010 - He bent to her and took into his own / Their married yearning joined like folded hopes; / As if a whole rich world suddenly possessed, / Wedded to all he had been became himself, / An inexhaustible joy made his alone, / He gathered all Savitri into his clasp.

05.03_104:011 - Around her his embrace became the sign / Of a locked closeness through slow intimate years, / A first sweet summary of delight to come, / One brevity intense of all long life.

05.03_104:012 - In a wide moment of two souls that meet / She felt her being flow into him as in waves / A river pours into a mighty sea.

05.03_104:013 - As when a soul is merging into God / To live in Him for ever and know His joy, / Her consciousness was a wave of him alone / And all her separate self was lost in his.

05.03_104:014 - As a starry heaven encircles happy earth, / He shut her into himself in a circle of bliss / And shut the world into himself and her.

05.03_104:015 - A boundless isolation made them one; / He was aware of her enveloping him / And let her penetrate his very soul, / As is a world by the world’s spirit filled, / As the mortal wakes into Eternity, / As the finite opens to the Infinite.

05.03_104:016 - Thus were they in each other lost awhile, / Then drawing back from their long ecstasy’s trance / Came into a new self and a new world.

05.03_104:017 - Each now was a part of the other’s unity.

05.03_104:018 - The world was but their twin self-finding’s scene / Or their own wedded being’s vaster frame.

05.03_104:019 - On the high glowing cupola of the day / Fate tied a knot with morning’s halo threads / While by the ministry of an auspice-hour / Heart-bound before the sun, their marriage fire, / The wedding of the eternal Lord and Spouse / Took place again on earth in human forms: / In a new act of the drama of the world / The united Two began a greater age.

05.03_104:020 - In the silence and murmur of that emerald world / And the mutter of the priest-wind’s sacred verse, / Amid the choral whisperings of the leaves / Love’s twain had joined together and grew one.

05.03_104:021 - The natural miracle was wrought once more: / In the immutable ideal world / One human moment was eternal made.


Section I - 105: for soon I shall return


05.03_105:001 - Then down the narrow path where their lives had met / He led and showed to her her future world, / Love’s refuge and corner of happy solitude.

05.03_105:002 - At the path’s end through a green cleft in the trees / She saw a clustering line of hermit-routes / And looked now first on her heart’s future home, / The thatch that covered the life of Satyavan.

05.03_105:003 - Adorned with creepers and red-climbing flowers / It seemed a sylvan beauty in her dreams / Slumbering with brown body and tumbled hair / In her chamber inviolate of emerald peace.

05.03_105:004 - Around it stretched the forest’s anchorite mood / Lost in the depths of its own solitude.

05.03_105:005 - Then moved by the deep joy she could not speak, / A little depth of it quivering in her words, / Her happy voice cried out to Satyavan: / “My heart will stay here on this forest verge / And close to this thatched roof while I am far: / Now of more wandering it has no need.

05.03_105:006 - But I must haste back to my father’s house / Which soon will lose one loved accustomed tread / And listen in vain for a once cherished voice.

05.03_105:007 - For soon I shall return nor ever again / Oneness must sever its recovered bliss / Or fate sunder our lives while life is ours.”

05.03_105:008 - Once more she mounted on the carven car / And under the ardour of a fiery noon / Less bright than the splendour of her thoughts and dreams / She sped swift-reined, swift-hearted but still saw / In still lucidities of sight’s inner world / Through the cool scented wood’s luxurious gloom / On shadowy paths between great rugged trunks / Pace towards a tranquil clearing Satyavan.

05.03_105:009 - A nave of trees enshrined the hermit thatch, / The new deep covert of her felicity, / Preferred to heaven her soul’s temple and home.

05.03_105:010 - This now remained with her, her heart’s constant scene.


Canto Book6 - 6: THE BOOK OF FATE

Canto 1 - 6.1: The Word of Fate

Section I - 106: the way of fate


06.01_106:001 - In silent bounds bordering the mortal’s plane / Crossing a wide expanse of brilliant peace / Narad the heavenly sage from Paradise / Came chanting through the large and lustrous air.

06.01_106:002 - Attracted by the golden summer-earth / That lay beneath him like a glowing bowl / Tilted upon a table of the Gods, / Turning as if moved round by an unseen hand / To catch the warmth and blaze of a small sun, / He passed from the immortals’ happy paths / To a world of toil and quest and grief and hope, / To these rooms of a see-saw game of death and life.

06.01_106:003 - Across an intangible border of soul-space / He passed from Mind into material things / Amid the inventions of the inconscient Self / And the workings of a blind somnambulist Force.

06.01_106:004 - Below him circling burned the myriad suns: / He bore the ripples of the etheric sea; / A primal Air brought the first joy of touch; / A secret Spirit drew its mighty breath.

06.01_106:005 - Contracting and expanding this huge world / The secret might of the creative fire / Displayed its triple power to build and form, / Its infinitesimal wave-sparks’ weaving dance, / Its nebulous units’ grounding shape and mass, / Magic foundation and pattern of a world, / Its radiance bursting into the light of stars; / He felt a sap of life, a sap of death; / Into solid Matter’s dense communion / Plunging and its obscure oneness of forms / He shared with a dumb Spirit identity.

06.01_106:006 - He beheld the cosmic Being at his task, / His eyes measured the spaces, gauged the depths, / His inner gaze the movements of the soul, / He saw the eternal labour of the Gods, / And looked upon the life of beasts and men.

06.01_106:007 - A change felt upon the singer’s mood, / A rapture and a pathos moved his voice; / He sang no more of light that never wanes, / And oneness and pure everlasting bliss, / He sang no more the deathless heart of love, / His chant was a hymn of Ignorance and Fate.

06.01_106:008 - He sang the name of Vishnu and the birth / And joy and passion of the mystic world, / And how the stars were made and life began / And the mute regions stirred with the throb of a soul.

06.01_106:009 - He sang the Inconscient and its secret self, / Its power omnipotent knowing not what it does, / All shaping without will or thought or sense, / Its blind unerring occult mystery, / And darkness yearning towards the eternal Light, / And Love that broods within the dim abyss / And waits the answer of the human heart, / And death that climbs immortality.

06.01_106:010 - He sang of the Truth that cries from Night’s blind deeps, / And the Mother Wisdom hid in Nature’s breast / And the Idea that through her dumbness works / And the miracle of her transforming hands, / Of life that slumbers in the stone and sun / And mind subliminal in mindless life, / And the consciousness that wakes in beasts and men.

06.01_106:011 - He sang of the glory and marvel still to be born, / Of the Godhead throwing off at last its veil, / Of bodies made divine and life made bliss, / Immortal sweetness clasping immortal might, / Heart sensing heart, thought looking straight at thought, / And the delight when every barrier falls, / And the transfiguration and the ecstasy.

06.01_106:012 - And as he sang the demons wept with joy / Foreseeing the end of their long dreadful task / And the defeat for which they hoped in vain, / And glad release from their self-chosen doom / And return into the One from whom they came.

06.01_106:013 - He who has conquered the immortals’ seats, / Came down to men on earth the Man divine.

06.01_106:014 - As might a lightning streak, a glory fell / Nearing until the rapt eyes of the sage / Looked out from luminous cloud and, strangely limned / His face, a beautiful mask of antique joy, / Appearing in light descended where arose / King Aswapathy’s palace to the winds / In Madra, flowering up in delicate stone.

06.01_106:015 - There welcomed him the sage and thoughtful king, / At his side a creature beautiful, passionate, wise, / Aspiring like a sacrificial flame, / Skyward from its earth-seat through luminous air, / Queen-browed, the human mother of Savitri.

06.01_106:016 - There for an hour untouched by the earth’s siege / They ceased from common life and care and sat / Inclining to the high and rhythmic voice, / While in his measured chant the heavenly seer / Spoke of the toils of men and what the gods / Strive for on earth, and joy that throbs behind / The marvel and the mystery of pain.

06.01_106:017 - He sang to them of the lotus-heart of love / With all its thousand luminous buds of truth, / Which quivering sleeps veiled by apparent things.

06.01_106:018 - It trembles at each touch, it strives to wake / And one day it shall hear a blissful voice / And in the garden of the Spouse shall bloom / When she is seized by her discovered lord.

06.01_106:019 - A mighty shuddering coil of ecstasy / Crept through the deep heart of the universe.

06.01_106:020 - Out of her Matter’s stupor, her mind’s dreams, / She woke, she looked upon God’s unveiled face.

06.01_106:021 - Even as he sang and rapture stole through earth-time / And caught the heavens, came with a call of hooves, / As of her swift heart hastening, Savitri; / Her radiant tread glimmered across the floor.

06.01_106:022 - A happy wonder in her fathomless gaze, / Changed by the halo of her love she came; / Her eyes rich with a shining mist of joy / As one who comes from a heavenly embassy / Discharging the proud mission of her heart, / One carrying the sanction of the gods / To her love and its luminous eternity / She stood before her mighty father’s throne / And, eager for beauty on discovered earth / Transformed and new in her heart’s miracle-light, / Saw like a rose of marvel, worshipping, / The fiery sweetness of the son of Heaven.

06.01_106:023 - He flung on her his vast immortal look; / His inner gaze surrounded her with its light / And reining back knowledge from his immortal lips / He cried to her, “Who is this that comes, the bride, / The flame-born, and round her illumined head / Pouring their lights her hymeneal pomps / Move flashing about her? From what green glimmer of glades / Retreating into dewy silences / Or half-seen verge of waters moon-betrayed / Bringst thou this glory of enchanted eyes?

06.01_106:024 - Earth has gold-hued expanses, shadowy hills / That cowl their dreaming phantom heads in night, / And guarded in a cloistral joy of woods, / Screened banks sink down into felicity / Seized by the curved incessant yearning hands / And ripple-passion of the up-gazing stream: / Amid cool-lipped murmurs of its pure embrace / They lose their souls on beds of trembling reeds.

06.01_106:025 - And all these are mysterious presences / In which some spirit’s immortal bliss is felt, / And they betray the earth-born heart to joy.

06.01_106:026 - There hast thou paused, and marvelling borne eyes / Unknown, or heard a voice that forced thy life / To strain its rapture through thy listening soul?

06.01_106:027 - Or, if my thought could trust this shimmering gaze, / It would say: thou hast not drunk from an earthly cup, / But stepping through azure curtains of the morn / Thou wast surrounded on a magic verge / In brighter countries than man’s eyes can bear.

06.01_106:028 - Assailed by trooping voices of delight / And seized mid a sunlit glamour of the boughs / In faery woods, led down the gleaming slopes / Of Gundhamadan where the Apsaras roam, / Thy limbs have shared the sports which none has seen, / And in god-haunts thy human footsteps strayed, / Thy mortal bosom quivered with god-speech / And thy soul answered to a Word unknown.

06.01_106:029 - What feet of gods, what ravishing flutes of heaven / Have thrilled high melodies round, from near and far / Approaching through the soft and revelling air, / Which still surprised thou hearest? They have fed / Thy silence on some red strange-ecstasied fruit / And thou hast trod the dim moon-peaks of bliss.

06.01_106:030 - Reveal, O winged with light, whence thou hast flown / Hastening bright-hued through the green-tangled earth, / Thy body rhythmical with the spring-bird’s call.

06.01_106:031 - The empty roses of thy hands are filled / Only with their own beauty and the thrill / Of a remembered clasp, and in thee glows / A heavenly jar, thy firm deep-honied heart, / New-brimming with a sweet and nectarous wine.

06.01_106:032 - Thou hast not spoken with the kings of pain.

06.01_106:033 - Life’s perilous music rings yet to thy ear / Far-melodied, rapid, grand, a Centaur’s song, / Or soft as water plashing mid the hills, / Or mighty as a great chant of many winds.

06.01_106:034 - Moon-bright thou livest in thy inner bliss.

06.01_106:035 - Thou comest like a silver deer through groves / Of coral flowers and buds of glowing dreams, / Or fleest like a wind-goddess through leaves, / Or roamest, O ruby-eyed and snow-winged dove, / Flitting through thickets of thy pure desires / In the unwounded beauty of thy soul.

06.01_106:036 - These things are only images to thy earth, / But truest truth of that which in thee sleeps.

06.01_106:037 - For such is thy spirit, a sister of the gods, / Thy earthly body lovely to the eyes, / And thou art kin in joy to heaven’s sons.

06.01_106:038 - O thou who hast come to this great perilous world / Now only seen through the splendour of thy dreams, / Where hardly love and beauty can live safe, / Thyself a being dangerously great, / A soul alone in a golden house of thought / Has lived walled in by the safety of thy dreams.

06.01_106:039 - On heights of happiness leaving doom asleep / Who hunts unseen the unconscious lives of men, / If thy heart could live locked in the ideal’s gold, / As high, as happy might thy waking be!

06.01_106:040 - If for all time doom could be left to sleep!”

06.01_106:041 -     He spoke but held his knowledge back from words.

06.01_106:042 - As a cloud plays with lightning’s vivid laugh, / But still holds back the thunder in its heart, / Only he let bright images escape.

06.01_106:043 - His speech like glimmering music veiled his thoughts; / Pitiful to mortals, only to them it spoke, / As a wind flatters the bright summer air, / Of living beauty and of present bliss: / He hid in his all-knowing mind the rest.

06.01_106:044 - To those who hearkened to his celestial voice, / The veil heaven’s pity throws on future pain / The Immortals’ sanction seemed of endless joy.

06.01_106:045 - But Aswapathy answered to the seer; / His listening mind had marked the dubious close, / An ominous shadow felt behind the words, / But calm like one who ever sits facing Fate / Here mid the dangerous contours of earth’s life, / He answered covert thought with guarded speech: / “O deathless sage who knowest all things here, / If I could read by the ray of my own wish / Through the carved shield of symbol images / Which thou hast thrown before thy heavenly mind / I might see the steps of a young godlike life / Happily beginning luminous-eyed on earth; / Between the Unknowable and the Unseen / Born on the borders of two wonder-worlds, / It flames out symbols of the Infinite / And lives in a great light of inner suns.

06.01_106:046 - For it has read and broken the hidden seals, / It has drunk of the Immortal’s wells of joy, / It has looked across the jewel bars of heaven, / It has entered the aspiring Secrecy, / It sees beyond terrestrial common things / And communes with the Powers that build the worlds, / Till through the shining gates and mystic streets / Of the city of lapis lazuli and pearl / Proud deeds step forth a rank and march of gods.

06.01_106:047 - Although in pauses of our human lives / Earth keeps for man some short and perfect hours / When the inconscient tread of Time can seem / The eternal moment which the deathless live, / Yet rare that touch upon the mortal’s world: / Hardly a soul and body here are born / In the fierce difficult movement of the stars, / Whose life can keep the paradisal note, / Its rhythm repeat the many-toned melody / Tirelessly throbbing through the rapturous air / Caught in the song that sways the Apsara’s limbs / When she floats gleaming like a cloud of light, / A wave of joy on heaven’s moon-stone floor.

06.01_106:048 - Behold this image cast by light and love, / A stanza of the ardour of the gods / Perfectly rhymed, a pillared ripple of gold!

06.01_106:049 - Her body like a brimmed pitcher of delight / Shaped in a splendour of gold-coloured bronze / As if to seize earth’s truth of hidden bliss.

06.01_106:050 - Dream-made illumined mirrors are her eyes / Draped subtly in a slumberous fringe of jet, / Retaining heaven’s reflections in their depths.

06.01_106:051 - Even as her body, such is she within, / Heaven’s lustrous mornings gloriously recur, / Like drops of fire upon a silver page, / In her young spirit yet untouched with tears.

06.01_106:052 - All beautiful things eternal seem and new / To virgin wonder in her crystal soul.

06.01_106:053 - The unchanging blue reveals its spacious thought; / Marvellous the moon floats on through wondering skies; / Earth’s flowers spring up and laugh at time and death; / The charmed mutations of the enchanter life / Race like bright children past the smiling hours.

06.01_106:054 - If but this joy of life could last, nor pain / Throw its bronze note into her rhythmed days!

06.01_106:055 - Behold her, singer with the prescient gaze, / And let thy blessing chant that this fair child / Shall pour the nectar of a sorrowless life / Around her from her lucid heart of love, / Heal with her bliss the tired breast of earth / And cast like a happy snare felicity.

06.01_106:056 - As grows the great and golden bounteous tree / Flowering by Alacananda’s murmuring waves, / Where with enamoured speed the waters run / Lisping and babbling to the splendour of morn / And cling with lyric laughter round the knees / Of heaven’s daughters dripping magic rain / Pearl-bright from moon-gold limbs and cloudy hair, / So are her dawns like jewelled leaves of light.

06.01_106:057 - So casts she her felicity on men.

06.01_106:058 - A flame of radiant happiness she was born, / And surely will that flame set earth alight: / Doom surely will see her pass and say no word, / But too often here the careless Mother leaves / Her chosen in the envious hands of Fate: / The harp of God falls mute, its call to bliss / Discouraged fails mid earth’s unhappy sounds; / The strings of the siren Ecstasy cry not here / Or sooner silenced in the human heart.

06.01_106:059 - Of sorrow’s songs we have enough: bid once / Her glad and griefless days ring heaven here.

06.01_106:060 - Or must fire always test the great of soul?

06.01_106:061 - Along the dreadful causeway of the gods / Armoured with love and faith and sacred joy, / A traveller to the Eternal’s house / Once let unwounded pass a mortal life.”

06.01_106:062 - But Narad answered not; silent he sat, / Knowing that words are vain and Fate is lord.

06.01_106:063 - He looked into the unseen with seeing eyes, / Then, dallying with the mortal’s ignorance / Like one who knows not, questioning, he cried: / “On what high mission went her hastening wheels?

06.01_106:064 - Whence came she with this glory in her heart / And Paradise made visible in her eyes?

06.01_106:065 - What sudden God has met, what face supreme?”

06.01_106:066 - To whom the king, “The red asoca watched / Her going forth which now sees her return.

06.01_106:067 - Arisen into an air of flaming dawn / Like a bright bird tired of her lonely branch / To find her own lord, since to her on earth / He came not yet, this sweetness wandered forth / Cleaving her way with the beat of her rapid wings.

06.01_106:068 - Led by a distant call her vague swift flight / Threaded the summer morns and sunlit lands.

06.01_106:069 - The happy rest her burdened lashes keep / And these charmed guardian lips hold treasured still.

06.01_106:070 - Virgin who comest perfected by joy, / Reveal the name thy sudden heart-beats learned.

06.01_106:071 - Whom hast thou chosen kingliest among men?”

06.01_106:072 - And Savitri answered with her still calm voice / As one who speaks beneath the eyes of Fate: / “Father and king, I have carried out thy will, / One whom I sought I found in distant lands; / I have obeyed my heart, I have heard its call.

06.01_106:073 - On the borders of a dreaming wilderness / Mid Shalwa’s giant hills and brooding woods, / In his thatched hermitage Dyumathsena dwells, / Blind, exiled, outcast, once a mighty king.

06.01_106:074 - The son of Dyumathsena, Satyavan / I have met on the wild forest’s lonely verge.

06.01_106:075 - My father, I have chosen. This is done.”

06.01_106:076 - Astonished, all sat silent for a space.

06.01_106:077 - Then Aswapathy looked within and saw / A heavy shadow float above the name / Chased by a sudden and stupendous light; / He looked into his daughter’s eyes and spoke: / “Well hast thou done and I approve thy choice.

06.01_106:078 - If this is all, then all is surely well; / If there is more, then all can still be well.

06.01_106:079 - Whether it seem good or evil to men’s eyes, / Only for good the secret Will can work.

06.01_106:080 - Our destiny is written in double terms: / Through Nature’s contraries we draw near God; / Out of the darkness we still grow to light.

06.01_106:081 - Death is our road to immortality.

06.01_106:082 - ‘Cry woe, cry woe’ the world’s lost voices wail, / Yet conquers the eternal Good at last.”

06.01_106:083 - Then might the sage have spoken, but the king / In haste broke out and stayed the dangerous word: / “O singer of ultimate ecstasy, / Lend not a dangerous vision to the blind, / Because by native right thou hast seen clear.

06.01_106:084 - Impose not on the mortal’s tremulous breast / The dire ordeal that foreknowledge brings; / Demand not now the godhead in our acts.

06.01_106:085 - Here are not happy peaks the heaven-nymphs roam, / Or Coilas or Vaicountha’s starry stair, / Abrupt jagged hills only the mighty climb / Are here where few dare even think to rise; / Far voices call down from the dizzy rocks, / Chill, slippery, precipitous are the paths.

06.01_106:086 - Too hard the gods are with man’s fragile race / In their large heavens they dwell exempt from Fate / And they forget the wounded feet of man, / His limbs that faint beneath the whips of grief, / His heart that hears the tread of time and death, / The future’s road is hid from mortal sight: / He moves towards a veiled and secret face.

06.01_106:087 - To light one step in front is all his hope / And only for a little strength he asks / To meet the riddle of his shrouded fate.

06.01_106:088 - Awaited by a vague and half-seen force, / Aware of danger to his uncertain hours / He guards his flickering yearnings from her breath; / He feels not when the dreadful fingers close / Around him with the grasp none can elude.

06.01_106:089 - If thou canst loose her grip then only speak, / Perhaps from the iron snare there is escape: / Our mind perhaps deceives us with its words / And gives the name of doom to our own choice; / Perhaps the blindness of our will is Fate."

06.01_106:090 - He said and Narad answered not the king.

06.01_106:091 - But now the queen alarmed lifted her voice: / “O seer, thy bright arrival has been timed / To this high moment of a happy life.

06.01_106:092 - Then let the speech benign of griefless spheres / Confirm this blithe conjunction of two stars / And sanction joy with thy celestial voice.

06.01_106:093 - Here drag not in the peril of our thoughts, / Let not our words create the doom they fear.

06.01_106:094 - Here is no cause for dread, no chance for grief / To raise her ominous head and stare at love: / A single spirit in a multitude, / Happy is Satyavan mid earthly men / Whom Savitri has chosen for her mate, / And fortunate the forest hermitage / Where leaving her palace and riches and a throne / My Savitri will dwell and bring in heaven.

06.01_106:095 - Then let thy blessing put the immortals’ seal / On these bright lives’ unstained felicity / Pushing the ominous Shadow from their days.

06.01_106:096 - Too heavy falls a Shadow on man’s heart; / It dares not be too happy upon earth.

06.01_106:097 - It dreads the blow dogging too vivid joys, / A lash unseen in Fate’s extended hand, / The danger lurking in fortune’s proud extremes, / An irony in life’s indulgent smile / And trembles at the laughter of the gods.

06.01_106:098 - Or if crouches unseen a panther doom, / If wings of Evil brood above that house, / Then also speak, that we may turn aside / And rescue our lives from hazard of wayside doom / And chance entanglement of an alien fate."

06.01_106:099 - And Narad slowly answered to the queen: / “What help is in prevision to the driven?

06.01_106:100 - Safe doors cry opening near, the doomed pass on.

06.01_106:101 - A future knowledge is an added pain, / A torturing burden and a fruitless light / On the enormous scene that Fate has built.

06.01_106:102 - The eternal poet, universal Mind, / Has paged each line of his imperial act; / Invisible the giant actors tread / And man lives like some secret player’s mask.

06.01_106:103 - He knows not even what his lips shall speak.

06.01_106:104 - For a mysterious Power compels his steps / And life is stronger than his trembling soul.

06.01_106:105 - None can refuse what the stark Force demands, / Her eyes are fixed upon her mighty aim; / No cry or prayer can turn her from her path, / She has leaped an arrow from the bow of God."

06.01_106:106 - His words were theirs who live unforced to grieve / And help by calm the swaying wheels of life / And the long restlessness of transient things / And the trouble and passion of the unquiet world.

06.01_106:107 - As though her own bosom were pierced the mother saw / The ancient human sentence strike her child, / Her sweetness that deserved another fate / Only a larger measure given of tears.

06.01_106:108 - Aspiring to the nature of the gods, / A mind proof-armoured mailed in mighty thoughts, / A will entire couchant behind wisdom’s shield, / Though to still heavens of knowledge she had risen, / Though calm and wise and Aswapathy’s queen, / Human was she still and opened her doors to grief; / The stony-eyed injustice she accused / Of the marble godhead of inflexible Law; / Nor sought the strength extreme adversity brings / To lives that stand erect and front the World-Power: / Her heart appealed against the impartial judge, / Taxed with perversity the impersonal One.

06.01_106:109 - Her tranquil spirit she called not to her aid, / But as a common man beneath his load / Grows faint and breathes his pain in ignorant words, / So now she arraigned the World's impassive will: / "What stealthy doom has crept across her path / Emerging from the dark forest's sullen heart, / What evil thing stood smiling by the way / And wore the beauty of the Shalwa boy?

06.01_106:110 - Perhaps he came an enemy from her past / Armed with a hidden force of ancient wrongs, / Himself unknowing, and seized her unknown.

06.01_106:111 - Here dreadfully entangled love and hate / Meet us blind wanderers mid the perils of Time.

06.01_106:112 - Our days are links of a disastrous chain, / Necessity avenges casual steps; / Old cruelties come back unrecognised, / The gods make use of our forgotten deeds.

06.01_106:113 - Yet all in vain the bitter law was made.

06.01_106:114 - Our own minds are the justicers of doom.

06.01_106:115 - For nothing have we learned, but still repeat / Our stark misuse of self and others' selves, / And fallen from his ethereal element / Love darkens to the spirit of nether gods.

06.01_106:116 - The dreadful angel angry with his joys / Woundingly sweet he cannot yet forego, / Is pitiless to the soul his gaze disarmed, / He visits with his own pangs his quivering prey / Forcing us to cling enamoured to his grip / As if in love with our own agony.

06.01_106:117 - This is one poignant misery in the world, / And grief has other lassoes for our life.

06.01_106:118 - Our sympathies become our tortures.

06.01_106:119 - Strength have I my own punishment to bear, / Knowing it just, but on this earth perplexed, / Smitten in the sorrow of scourged and helpless things, / Often it faints to meet other suffering eyes.

06.01_106:120 - We are not as the gods who know not grief / And look impassive on a suffering world, / Calm they gaze down on the little human scene / And the short-lived passion crossing mortal hearts.

06.01_106:121 - An ancient tale of woe can move us still, / We keep the ache of breasts that breathe no more, / We are shaken by the sight of human pain, / And share the miseries that others feel.

06.01_106:122 - Ours not the passionless lids that cannot age.

06.01_106:123 - Too hard for us is heaven's indifference: / Our own tragedies are not enough for us, / All pathos and all sufferings we make ours; / We have sorrow for a greatness passed away / And feel the touch of tears in mortal things.

06.01_106:124 - Even a stranger's anguish rends my heart, / And this, O Narad, is my well-loved child.

06.01_106:125 - Hide not from us our doom, if doom is ours.

06.01_106:126 - This is the worst, an unknown face of Fate, / A terror ominous mute felt more than seen / Behind our seat by day, our couch by night, / A Fate lurking in the shadow of our hearts, / The anguish of the unseen that waits to strike.

06.01_106:127 - To know is best, however hard to bear."

06.01_106:128 - Then cried the sage piercing the mother's heart, / Forcing to steel the will of Savitri / His words set free the spring of cosmic Fate.

06.01_106:129 - The great Gods use the pain of human hearts / As a sharp axe to hew their cosmic road: / They squander lavishly men's blood and tears / For a moment's purpose in their fateful work.

06.01_106:130 - This cosmic Nature's balance is not ours / Nor the mystic measure of her need and use.

06.01_106:131 - A single word lets loose vast agencies, / A casual act determines the world's fate.

06.01_106:132 - "So now he set free destiny in that hour: / The truth thou hast claimed; I give to thee the truth.

06.01_106:133 - A marvel of the meeting earth and heavens / Is he whom Savitri has chosen mid men, / His figure is the front of Nature's march, / His single being excels the works of Time.

06.01_106:134 - A sapphire cutting from the sleep of heaven, / Delightful is the soul of Satyavan, / A ray out of the rapturous infinite, / A silence waking to a hymn of joy.

06.01_106:135 - A divinity and kingliness gird his brow; / His eyes keep a memory from a world of bliss.

06.01_106:136 - As brilliant as a lonely moon in heaven, / Gentle like the sweet bud that spring desires, / Pure like a stream that kisses silent banks, / He takes with bright surprise spirit and sense.

06.01_106:137 - A living knot of golden Paradise, / A blue Immense he leans to the longing world, / Time's joy borrowed out of eternity, / A star of splendour or a rose of bliss.

06.01_106:138 - In him Soul and Nature, equal Presences, / Balance and fuse in a wide harmony.

06.01_106:139 - The Happy in their bright ether have not hearts / More sweet and true than this of mortal make / That takes all joy as the world's native gift / And to all gives joy as the world's natural right.

06.01_106:140 - His speech carries a light of inner truth, / And a large-eyed communion with the Power / In common things has made veilless his mind, / A seer in earth-shapes of garbless deity.

06.01_106:141 - A tranquil breadth of sky windless and still / Watching the world like a mind of unplumbed thought, / A silent space musing and luminous / Uncovered by the morning to delight, / A green tangle of trees upon a happy hill / Made into a murmuring nest by southern winds, / These are his images and parallels, / His kin in beauty and in depth his peers.

06.01_106:142 - A will to climb lifts a delight to live / Heaven's height companion of earth-beauty's charm, / An aspiration to the immortals' air / Lain on the lap of mortal ecstasy.

06.01_106:143 - His sweetness and his joy attract all hearts / To live with his own in a glad tenancy, / His strength is like a tower built to reach heaven, / A godhead quarried from the stones of life.

06.01_106:144 - O loss, if death into its elements / Of which his gracious envelope was built / Shatter this vase before it breathes its sweets, / As if earth could not keep too long from heaven / A treasure thus unique loaned by the gods, / A being so rare, of so divine a make!

06.01_106:145 - In one brief year when this bright hour flies back / And perches careless on a branch of Time, / This sovereign glory ends heaven lent to earth, / This splendour vanishes from the mortal's sky: / Heaven's greatness came, but was too great to stay.

06.01_106:146 - Twelve swift-winged months are given to him and her; / This day returning Satyavan must die."

06.01_106:147 - A lightning bright and nude the sentence fell.

06.01_106:148 - But the queen cried: “Vain then can be Heaven’s grace!

06.01_106:149 - Heaven mocks us with the brilliance of its gifts, / For Death is a cupbearer of the wine / Of too brief joy held up to mortal lips / For a passionate moment by the careless gods.

06.01_106:150 - But I reject the grace and the mockery.

06.01_106:151 - Mounting thy car go forth, O Savitri, / And travel once more through the peopled lands.

06.01_106:152 - Alas, in the green gladness of the woods / Thy heart has stooped to a misleading call.

06.01_106:153 - Choose once again and leave this fated head, / Death is the gardener of this wonder-tree; / Love’s sweetness sleeps in his pale marble hand.

06.01_106:154 - Advancing in a honeyed line, but closed / A little joy would buy too bitter an end.

06.01_106:155 - Plead not thy choice, for death has made it vain.

06.01_106:156 - Thy youth and radiance were not born to lie / A casket void dropped on a careless soil; / A choice less rare may call a happier fate.”

06.01_106:157 - But Savitri answered from her violent heart,— / Her voice was calm, her face was fixed like steel: / “Once my heart chose and chooses not again.

06.01_106:158 - The word I have spoken can never be erased, / It is written in the record book of God.

06.01_106:159 - The truth once uttered, from the earth’s air effaced, / By mind forgotten, sounds immortally / For ever in the memory of Time.

06.01_106:160 - Once the dice fall thrown by the hand of Fate / In an eternal moment of the gods.

06.01_106:161 - My heart has sealed its troth to Satyavan: / Its signature adverse Fate cannot efface, / Its seal not Fate nor Death nor Time dissolve.

06.01_106:162 - Those who shall part who have grown one being within?

06.01_106:163 - Death’s grip can break our bodies, not our souls; / If death take him, I too know how to die.

06.01_106:164 - Let Fate do with me what she will or can; / I am stronger than death and greater than my fate; / My love shall outlast the world, doom falls from me / Helpless against my immortality.

06.01_106:165 - Fate’s law may change, but not my spirit’s will.”

06.01_106:166 - An adamant will, she cast her speech like bronze, / But in the queen’s mind listening her words / Rang like the voice of a self-chosen Doom / Denying every issue of escape.

06.01_106:167 - To her own despair answer the mother made; / As one she cried who in her heavy heart / Labours amid the sobbing of her hopes / To wake a note of help from sadder strings; / “O child, in the magnificence of thy soul / Dwelling on the border of a greater world, / And, dazzled by thy superhuman thoughts, / Thou lendst eternity to a mortal hope.

06.01_106:168 - Here on this mutable and ignorant earth, / Who is the lover and who is the friend?

06.01_106:169 - All passes here, nothing remains the same.

06.01_106:170 - None is for any on this transient globe.

06.01_106:171 - He whom thou lovest now, a stranger came / And into a far strangeness shall depart.

06.01_106:172 - His moment’s part once done upon life’s stage / Which for a time was given him from within, / To other scenes he moves and other players / And laughs and weeps mid faces new, unknown.

06.01_106:173 - The body thou hast loved is cast away / Amidst the brute unchanging stuff of worlds / To indifferent mighty Nature and becomes / Crude matter for the joy of others’ lives.

06.01_106:174 - But for our souls, upon the wheel of God / For ever turning, they arrive and go, / Married and sundered in the magic round / Of the great Dancer of the boundless dance.

06.01_106:175 - Our emotions are but high and dying notes / Of his wild music changed compellingly / By the passionate movements of a seeking Heart / In the incessant links of hour with hour.

06.01_106:176 - To call down heaven’s distant answering song, / To cry to an unseized bliss is all we dare; / Once seized, we lose the heavenly music’s sense; / Too near, the rhythmic cry has fled or failed; / All sweetnesses are baffling symbols here.

06.01_106:177 - Love dies before the lover in our breast: / Our joys are perfumes in a brittle vase.

06.01_106:178 - O then what wreck is this upon Time’s sea / To spread life’s sails to the hurricane desire / And call for pilot the unseeing heart!

06.01_106:179 - O child, wilt thou proclaim, wilt thou then follow / Against the Law that is the eternal will / The autarchy of the rash titan’s mood / To whom his own fierce will is the one law / In a world where Truth is not, nor Light nor God?

06.01_106:180 - Only the gods can speak what now thou speakst.

06.01_106:181 - Thou who art human, think not like a god.

06.01_106:182 - For man, below the god, above the brute, / Is given the calm reason as his guide; / He is not driven by an unthinking will / As are the actions of the bird and beast; / He is not moved by stark Necessity / Like the senseless motion of inconscient things.

06.01_106:183 - The giant’s and the titan’s furious march / Climbs to usurp the kingdom of the gods / Or skirts the demon magnitudes of Hell; / In the unreflecting passion of their hearts / They dash their lives against the eternal Law / And fall and break by their own violent mass: / The middle path is made for thinking man.

06.01_106:184 - To choose his steps by reason’s vigilant light, / To choose his path among the many paths / Is given him, for each his difficult goal / Hewn out of infinite possibility.

06.01_106:185 - Leave not thy goal to follow a beautiful face.

06.01_106:186 - Only when thou hast climbed above thy mind / And livst in the calm vastness of the One / Can love be eternal in the eternal bliss / And Love divine replace the human tie.

06.01_106:187 - There is a shrouded law, an austere force: / It bids thee strengthen thy undying spirit; / It offers its severe benignances / Of work and thought and measured grave delight / As steps to climb to God’s far secret heights.

06.01_106:188 - Then is our life a tranquil pilgrimage, / Each year a mile from the heavenly Way, / Each dawn opens into a larger Light.

06.01_106:189 - Thy acts are thy helpers, or events are signs, / Waking and sleep are opportunities / Given to thee by an immortal Power: / So canst thou raise thy pure unvanquished spirit / Till spread to heaven in a wide vesper calm / Indifferent and gentle as the sky, / It greatens slowly into timeless peace.”

06.01_106:190 - But Savitri replied with steadfast eyes: / “My will is part of the eternal will, / My fate is what my spirit’s strength can make, / My fate is what my spirit’s strength can bear; / My strength is not the titan’s, it is God’s.

06.01_106:191 - I have discovered my glad reality / Beyond my body in another’s being: / I have found the deep unchanging soul of love.

06.01_106:192 - Then how shall I desire a lonely good, / Or slay, aspiring to white vacant peace, / The endless hope that made my soul spring forth / Out of its infinite solitude and sleep?

06.01_106:193 - My spirit has glimpsed the glory for which it came, / Beating of one vast heart in the flame of things, / My eternity clasped by his eternity / And, tireless of the sweet abysms of Time, / Deep possibility always to love.

06.01_106:194 - This, this is first, last joy and to its throb / The riches of a thousand fortunate years / Are a poverty. Nothing to me are death and grief / Or ordinary lives and happy days.

06.01_106:195 - And what to me are common souls of men / Or eyes and lips that are not Satyavan’s?

06.01_106:196 - I have no need to draw back from his arms / And the discovered paradise of his love / And journey into a still infinity.

06.01_106:197 - Only now for my soul in Satyavan / I treasure the rich occasion of my birth: / In sunlight and a dream of emerald ways / I shall walk with him like gods in Paradise.

06.01_106:198 - If for a year, that year is all my life / And yet I know this is not all my fate / Only to live and love awhile and die.

06.01_106:199 - For I know now why my spirit came on earth / And who I am and who he is I love.

06.01_106:200 - I have looked at him from my immortal Self, / I have seen God smile at me in Satyavan; / I have seen the Eternal in a human face.”

06.01_106:201 - Then none could answer to her words. Silent / They sat and looked into the eyes of Fate.


Canto 2 - 6.2: The Way of Fate and the Problem of Pain

Section I - 107: laid for us a snare


06.02_107:001 - A silence sealed the irrevocable decree, / The word of Fate that fell from the heavenly lips / Fixing a doom no power could ever reverse / Unless heaven’s will itself could change its course.

06.02_107:002 - Or so it seemed; yet from the silence rose / One voice that questioned changeless destiny.

06.02_107:003 - A will that strove against the immutable Will, / A mother’s heart had heard the fateful speech / That rang like a sanction to the call of death / And came like a chill close to life and hope.

06.02_107:004 - Yet hope sank down like an extinguished fire.

06.02_107:005 - She felt the leaden inevitable hand / Invade the secrecy of her guarded soul / And smite with sudden pain its still content / And the empire of her hard-won quietude.

06.02_107:006 - Awhile she fell to the level of human mind, / A field of mortal grief and Nature’s law / She shared, she bore the common lot of men / And felt what common hearts endure in Time.

06.02_107:007 - Voicing earth’s question to the inscrutable power / The queen now turned to the still immobile seer: / Assailed by the discontent in Nature’s depths, / Partner in the agony of dumb driven things / And all the misery, all the ignorant cry, / Passionate like sorrow questioning heaven she spoke.

06.02_107:008 - Awhile she lost her spirit’s tranquil poise, / Awhile she shared the lot of common souls / And bore the heavy hand of Death and Time / And felt the anguish in life’s stricken deeps.

06.02_107:009 - Lending her speech to the surface soul on earth / She uttered the suffering in the world’s dumb heart / And man’s revolt against his ignorant fate.

06.02_107:010 - “O seer, in the earth’s strange twi-natured life, / By what pitiless adverse Necessity / Or what cold freak of a Creator’s will, / By what random accident or governed Chance / That shaped a rule out of fortuitous steps, / Made destiny from an hour’s emotion, came / The direr mystery of grief and pain?

06.02_107:011 - Is it thy God who made this cruel law?

06.02_107:012 - Or some disastrous Power has marred his work / And he stands helpless to defend or save?

06.02_107:013 - A fatal seed was sown in life’s false start / When evil twinned with good on earthly soil.

06.02_107:014 - Then first appeared the malady of mind, / Its pang of thought, its quest for the aim of life.

06.02_107:015 - It twisted into forms of good and ill / The frank simplicity of the animal’s acts; / It turned the straight path hewn by the body’s gods, / Followed the zigzag of the uncertain course / Of life that wanders seeking for its aim / In the pale starlight falling from thought’s skies; / It guides the unsure idea, the wavering will.

06.02_107:016 - Lost was the instinct’s safe identity / With the arrow-point of being’s inmost sight, / Marred the sure steps of Nature’s simple walk / And truth and freedom in the growing soul.

06.02_107:017 - Out of some ageless innocence and peace, / Privilege of souls not yet betrayed to birth, / Cast down to suffer on this hard dangerous earth / Our life was born in pain and with a cry.

06.02_107:018 - Although earth-nature welcomes heaven’s breath / Inspiring Matter with the will to live, / A thousand ills assail the mortal’s hours / And wear away the natural joy of life; / Our bodies are an engine cunningly made, / But for all its parts as cunningly are planned, / Contrived ingeniously with demon skill / Its apt inevitable heritage / Of mortal danger and peculiar pain, / Its payment of the tax of Time and Fate, / Its way to suffer and its way to die.

06.02_107:019 - This is the ransom of our high estate, / The sign and stamp of our humanity.

06.02_107:020 - A grisly company of maladies / Come, licensed lodgers, into man’s bodily house, / Purveyors of death and torturers of life.

06.02_107:021 - In the malignant hollows of the world, / In its subconscient cavern-passages / Ambushed they lie waiting their hour to leap, / Surrounding with danger the sieged city of life: / Admitted into the citadel of man’s days / They mine his force and maim or suddenly kill.

06.02_107:022 - Ourselves within us lethal forces nurse; / We make of our own enemies our guests: / Out of their holes like beasts they creep and gnaw / The chords of the divine musician’s lyre / Till frayed and thin the music dies away / Or crashing snaps with a last tragic note.

06.02_107:023 - All that we are is like a fort beset: / All that we strive to be alters like a dream / In the grey sleep of Matter’s ignorance.

06.02_107:024 - Mind suffers lamed by the world’s disharmony / And the unloveliness of human things.

06.02_107:025 - A treasure misspent or cheaply, fruitlessly sold / In the bazar of a blind destiny, / A gift of priceless values from Time’s gods / Lost or mislaid in an uncaring world, / Life is a marvel missed, an art gone wry; / A seeker in a dark and obscure place, / An ill-armed warrior facing dreadful odds, / An imperfect worker given a baffling task, / An ignorant judge of problems Ignorance made, / Its heavenward flights reach closed and keyless gates, / Its glorious outbursts peter out in mire.

06.02_107:026 - On Nature’s gifts to man a curse was laid.

06.02_107:027 - All walks inarmed by its own opposites, / Error is the comrade of our mortal thought, / And falsehood lurks in the deep bosom of truth, / Sin poisons with its vivid flowers of joy / Or leaves a red scar burnt across the soul; / Virtue is a grey bondage and a gaol.

06.02_107:028 - At every step is laid for us a snare.

06.02_107:029 - Alien to reason and the spirit’s light, / Our fount of action from a darkness wells; / In ignorance and nescience are our roots.

06.02_107:030 - A growing register of calamities / Is the past’s account, the future’s book of Fate: / The centuries pile man’s follies and man’s crimes / Upon the countless crowd of Nature’s ills; / As if the world’s stone load was not enough, / A crop of miseries obstinately is sown / By his own hand in the furrows of the gods, / The vast increasing tragic harvest reaped / From old misdeeds buried by oblivious Time.

06.02_107:031 - He walks by his own choice into hell’s trap; / This mortal creature is his own worst foe.

06.02_107:032 - His science is an artificer of doom; / He ransacks earth for means to harm his kind; / He slays his happiness and others’ good.

06.02_107:033 - Nothing has he learnt from time and its history; / Even as of old in the raw youth of Time, / When earth ignorant ran on the highways of Fate, / Old forms of evil cling to the world’s soul: / War making nought the sweet smiling calm of life, / Battle and rapine, ruin and massacre / Are still the fierce pastimes of man’s warring tribes; / An idiot hour destroys what centuries made, / His wanton rage or frenzied hate lays low / The beauty and greatness by his genius wrought / And the mighty output of a nation’s toil.

06.02_107:034 - All he has achieved he drags to the precipice.

06.02_107:035 - His grandeur he turns to an epic of doom and fall; / His littleness crawls content through squalor and mud, / He calls heaven’s retribution on his head, / And wallows in his self-made misery.

06.02_107:036 - A part author of the cosmic tragedy, / His will conspires with death and time and fate.

06.02_107:037 - His brief appearance on the enigmaed earth / Ever recurs, but brings no high result / To this wanderer through the aeon-rings of God / That shut his life in their vast longevity.

06.02_107:038 - His soul’s wide search and ever returning hopes / Pursue the useless orbit of their course / In a vain repetition of lost toils / Across a track of soon forgotten lives.

06.02_107:039 - All is an episode in a meaningless tale.

06.02_107:040 - Why is it all and wherefore are we here?

06.02_107:041 - If to some being of eternal bliss / It is our spirit’s destiny to return / Or some still impersonal height of endless calm, / Since That we are and out of That we came, / Whence rose the strange and sterile interlude / Lasting in vain through interminable Time?

06.02_107:042 - Or if these beings must be and their brief lives, / What need had the soul of ignorance and tears?

06.02_107:043 - Whence rose the call for sorrow and for pain?

06.02_107:044 - Or all came helplessly without a cause?

06.02_107:045 - What power forced the immortal spirit to birth?

06.02_107:046 - The eternal witness once of eternity, / A deathless sojourner mid transient scenes / He camps in life’s half-lit obscurity / Amid the debris of his thoughts and dreams.

06.02_107:047 - Or who persuaded it to fall from bliss / And forfeit its immortal privilege?

06.02_107:048 - Who laid on it the ceaseless will to live / A wanderer in this beautiful, sorrowful world, / And bear its load of joy and grief and love?

06.02_107:049 - Or if no being watches the works of Time, / What hard impersonal Necessity / Compels the vain toil of brief living things?

06.02_107:050 - A great Illusion then has built the stars.

06.02_107:051 - But where then is the soul’s security, / Its poise in this circling of unreal suns?

06.02_107:052 - Or else it is a wanderer from its home / Who strayed into a blind alley of Time and chance / And finds no issue from a meaningless world.

06.02_107:053 - Or where begins and ends Illusion’s reign?

06.02_107:054 - Perhaps the soul we feel is only a dream, / Eternal self a fiction sensed in trance."


Section I - 108: was then sun a dream?


06.02_108:001 - Then after a silence Narad made reply: / Tuning his lips to earthly sound he spoke, / And something now of the deep sense of fate / Weighted the fragile hints of mortal speech.

06.02_108:002 - His forehead shone with vision solemnised, / Turned to a tablet of supernal thoughts / As if characters of an unwritten tongue / Had left in its breadth the inscriptions of the gods.

06.02_108:003 - Bare in that Light Time toiled, his unseen works / Detected, the broad-flung far-seeing schemes / Unfinished which his aeoned flight unrolls / Were mapped already in that world-wide look: / “Was then the sun a dream because there is night?

06.02_108:004 - Hidden in the mortal’s heart the Eternal lives: / He lives secret in the chamber of thy soul, / A light shines there nor pain nor grief can cross.

06.02_108:005 - A darkness stands between thyself and him, / Thou canst not hear or feel the marvellous Guest, / Thou canst not see the beatific sun.

06.02_108:006 - O queen, thy thought is a light of the Ignorance, / Its brilliant curtain hides from thee God’s face.

06.02_108:007 - It illumines a world born from the Inconscience, / But hides the Immortal’s meaning in the world.

06.02_108:008 - Thy mind’s light hides from thee the Eternal’s thought, / Thy heart’s hopes hide from thee the Eternal’s will, / Earth’s joys shut from thee the Immortal’s bliss.

06.02_108:009 - Thence rose the need of a dark intruding god, / The world’s dread teacher, the creator, pain.

06.02_108:010 - Where Ignorance is, there suffering too must come; / Thy grief is a cry of darkness to the Light; / Pain was the first-born of the Inconscience / Which was thy body’s dumb original base; / Already slept there pain’s subconscient shape: / A shadow in a shadowy tenebrous womb, / Till life shall move, it waits to wake and be.

06.02_108:011 - In one caul with joy came forth the dreadful Power.

06.02_108:012 - In life’s breast it was born hiding its twin; / But pain came first, then only joy could be.

06.02_108:013 - Pain ploughed the first hard ground of the world-drowse.

06.02_108:014 - By pain a spirit started from the clod, / By pain Life stirred in the subliminal deep.

06.02_108:015 - Interned, submerged, hidden in Matter’s trance / Awoke to itself the dreamer, sleeping Mind; / It made a visible realm out of its dreams, / It drew its shapes from the subconscient depths, / Then turned to look upon the world it had made.

06.02_108:016 - By pain and joy, the bright and tenebrous twins, / The inanimate world perceived its sentient soul, / Else had the Inconscient never suffered change.

06.02_108:017 - Pain is the hammer of the gods to break / A dead resistance in the mortal’s heart, / His slow inertia as of living stone.

06.02_108:018 - If the heart were not forced to want and weep, / His soul would have lain down content, at ease, / And never thought to exceed the human start / And never learned to climb towards the Sun.

06.02_108:019 - This earth is full of labour, packed with pain; / Throes of an endless birth coerce her still; / The centuries end, the ages vainly pass / And yet the godhead in her is not born.

06.02_108:020 - The ancient Mother faces all with joy, / Calls for the ardent pang, the grandiose thrill; / For with pain and labour all creation comes.

06.02_108:021 - This earth is full of the anguish of the gods; / Ever they travail driven by Time’s goad, / And strive to work out the eternal will / And shape the life divine in mortal forms.

06.02_108:022 - His will must be worked out in human breasts / Against the Evil that rises from the gulfs, / Against man’s ignorance and his obstinate strength, / Against the deep folly of his human mind, / Against the blind reluctance of his human heart.

06.02_108:023 - The spirit is doomed to pain till man is free.

06.02_108:024 - There is a clamour of battle, a tramp, a march: / A cry arises like a moaning sea, / A desperate laughter under the blows of death, / A doom of blood and sweat and toil and tears.

06.02_108:025 - Men die that man may live and God be born.

06.02_108:026 - An awful Silence watches tragic Time.

06.02_108:027 - Pain is the hand of Nature sculpturing men / To greatness: an inspired labour chisels / With heavenly cruelty an unwilling mould.

06.02_108:028 - Implacable in the passion of their will, / Lifting the hammers of titanic toil / The demiurges of the universe work; / They shape with giant strokes their own; their sons / Are marked with their enormous stamp of fire.

06.02_108:029 - Although the shaping god’s tremendous touch / Is torture unbearable to mortal nerves, / The fiery spirit grows in strength within / And feels a joy in every titan pang.

06.02_108:030 - He who would save himself lives bare and calm; / He who would save the race must share its pain: / This he shall know who obeys that grandiose urge.

06.02_108:031 - The great who came to save this suffering world / And rescue out of Time’s shadow and the Law, / Must pass beneath the yoke of grief and pain: / They are caught by the Wheel that they had hoped to break, / On their shoulders they must bear man’s load of fate.

06.02_108:032 - Heaven’s riches they bring, their sufferings count the price / Or they pay the gift of knowledge with their lives.

06.02_108:033 - The Son of God born as the Son of man / Has drunk the bitter cup, owned Godhead’s debt, / The debt the Eternal owes to the fallen kind / His will has bound to death and struggling life / That yearns in vain for rest and endless peace.

06.02_108:034 - Now is the debt paid, wiped off the original score.

06.02_108:035 - The Eternal suffers in a human form, / He has signed salvation’s testament with his blood: / He has opened the doors of his undying peace.

06.02_108:036 - The Deity compensates the creature’s claim, / The Creator bears the law of pain and death; / A retribution smites the incarnate God.

06.02_108:037 - His love has paved the mortal’s road to Heaven: / He has given his life and light to balance here / The dark account of mortal ignorance.

06.02_108:038 - It is finished, the dread mysterious sacrifice, / Offered by God’s martyred body for the world; / Gethsemane and Calvary are his lot, / He carries the cross on which man’s soul is nailed; / His escort is the curses of the crowd; / Insult and jeer are his right’s acknowledgment; / Two thieves slain with him mock his mighty death.

06.02_108:039 - He has trod with bleeding brow the Saviour’s way.

06.02_108:040 - He who has found his identity with God / Pays with the body’s death his soul’s vast light.

06.02_108:041 - His knowledge immortal triumphs by his death.

06.02_108:042 - Hewn, quartered on the scaffold as he falls / His crucified voice proclaims, “I, I am God;” / “Yes, all is God,” peals back Heaven’s deathless call.

06.02_108:043 - The seed of Godhead sleeps in mortal hearts, / The flower of Godhead grows on the world-tree: / All shall discover God in self and things, / But when God’s messenger comes to help the world / And lead the soul of earth to higher things, / He too must carry the yoke he came to unloose; / He too must bear the pang that he would heal: / Exempt and unafflicted by earth’s fate, / How shall he cure the ills he never felt?

06.02_108:044 - He covers the world’s agony with his calm; / But though to the outward eye no sign appears / And peace is given to our torn human hearts, / The struggle is there and paid the unseen price; / The fire, the strife, the wrestle are within.

06.02_108:045 - He carries the suffering world in his own breast; / Its sins weigh on his thoughts, its grief is his: / Earth’s ancient load lies heavy on his soul; / Night and its powers beleaguer his tardy steps, / The titan adversary’s clutch he bears; / His march is a battle and a pilgrimage.

06.02_108:046 - Life’s evil smites, he is stricken with the world’s pain: / A million wounds gape in his secret heart.

06.02_108:047 - He journeys sleepless through an unending night; / Antagonist forces crowd across his path; / A siege, a combat is his inner life.

06.02_108:048 - Even worse may be the cost, direr the pain: / His large identity and all-harbouring love / Shall bring the cosmic anguish into his depths, / The sorrow of all living things shall come / And knock at his doors and live within his house; / A dreadful cord of sympathy can tie / All suffering into his single grief and make / All agony in all the worlds his own.

06.02_108:049 - He meets an ancient adversary Force, / He is lashed with the whips that tear the world’s worn heart; / The weeping of the centuries visits his eyes: / He wears the blood-glued fiery Centaur’s shirt, / The poison of the world has stained his throat.

06.02_108:050 - In the market-place of Matter’s capital / Amidst the chafferings of the affair called life / He is tied to the stake of a perennial Fire, / He burns on an unseen original verge / That Matter may be turned to spirit stuff: / He is the victim in his own sacrifice.

06.02_108:051 - The Immortal bound to earth’s mortality / Appearing and perishing on the roads of Time / Creates God’s moment by eternity’s beats.

06.02_108:052 - He dies that the world may be new-born and live.

06.02_108:053 - Even if he escapes the fiercest fires, / Even if the world breaks not in, a drowning sea, / Only by hard sacrifice is high heaven earned: / He must face the fight, the pang who would conquer Hell.

06.02_108:054 - A dark concealed hostility is lodged / In the human depths, in the hidden heart of Time / That claims the right to change and mar God’s work.

06.02_108:055 - A secret enmity ambushes the world’s march; / It leaves a mark on thought and speech and act: / It stamps stain and defect on all things done; / Till it is slain peace is forbidden on earth.

06.02_108:056 - There is no visible foe, but the unseen / Is round us, forces intangible besiege, / Touches from alien realms, thoughts not our own / Overtake us and compel the erring heart; / Our lives are caught in an ambiguous net.

06.02_108:057 - An adversary Force was born of old: / Invader of the life of mortal man, / It hides from him the straight immortal path.

06.02_108:058 - A power came in to veil the eternal Light, / A power opposed to the eternal will / Diverts the messages of the infallible Word, / Contorts the contours of the cosmic plan: / A whisper lures to evil the human heart, / It seals up wisdom’s eyes, the soul’s regard, / It is the origin of our suffering here, / It binds earth to calamity and pain.

06.02_108:059 - This all must conquer who would bring down God’s peace.

06.02_108:060 - This hidden foe lodged in the human breast / Man must overcome or miss his higher fate.

06.02_108:061 - This is the inner war without escape.



Section I - 109


06.02_109:001 - Hard is the world-redeemer’s heavy task; / The world itself becomes his adversary, / His enemies are the beings he came to save.

06.02_109:002 - Those he would save are his antagonists: / This world is in love with its own ignorance, / Its darkness turns away from the saviour light, / It gives the cross in payment for the crown.

06.02_109:003 - His work is a trickle of splendour in a long night; / He sees the long march of Time, the little won; / A few are saved, the rest strive on and fail: / A Sun has passed, on earth Night’s shadow falls.

06.02_109:004 - Yes, there are happy ways near to God’s sun; / But few are they who tread the sunlit path; / Only the pure in soul can walk in light.

06.02_109:005 - An exit is shown, a road of hard escape / From the sorrow and the darkness and the chain; / But how shall a few escaped release the world?

06.02_109:006 - The human mass lingers beneath the yoke.

06.02_109:007 - Escape, however high, redeems not life, / Life that is left behind on a fallen earth.

06.02_109:008 - Escape cannot uplift the abandoned race / Or bring to it victory and the reign of God.

06.02_109:009 - A greater power must come, a larger light.

06.02_109:010 - Although Light grows on earth and Night recedes, / Yet till the evil is slain in its own home / And Light invades the world’s inconscient base / And perished has the adversary Force, / He still must labour on, his work half done.

06.02_109:011 - One yet may come armoured, invincible; / His will immobile meets the mobile hour; / The world’s blows cannot bend that victor head; / Calm and sure are his steps in the growing Night; / The goal recedes, he hurries not his pace, / He turns not to high voices in the Night.

06.02_109:012 - He asks no aid from the inferior gods; / His eyes are fixed on the immutable aim.

06.02_109:013 - Man turns aside or chooses easier paths; / He keeps to the one high and difficult road / That sole can climb to the eternal’s peaks; / The ineffable planes already have felt his tread; / He has made heaven and earth his instruments, / But the limits fall from him of earth and heaven; / Their law he transcends but uses as his means.

06.02_109:014 - He has seized life’s hands, he has mastered his own heart.

06.02_109:015 - The feints of Nature mislead not his sight, / Inflexible his look towards Truth’s far end; / Fate’s deaf resistance cannot break his will.

06.02_109:016 - In the dreadful passages, the fatal paths, / Invulnerable his soul, his heart unslain,[1] / He lives through the opposition of earth’s Powers / And Nature’s ambushes and the world’s attacks.

06.02_109:017 - His spirit’s stature transcending pain and bliss / He fronts evil and good with calm and equal eyes.

06.02_109:018 - He too must grapple with the riddling Sphinx / And plunge into her long obscurity.

06.02_109:019 - He has broken into the Inconscient’s depths / That veil themselves even from their own regard: / He has seen God’s slumber shape these magic worlds.

06.02_109:020 - He has watched the dumb God fashioning Matter’s frame, / Dreaming the dreams of its unknowing sleep, / And watched the unconscious Force that built the stars.

06.02_109:021 - He has learnt the Inconscient’s workings and its law, / Its incoherent thoughts and rigid acts, / Its hazard wastes of impulse and idea, / The chaos of its mechanic frequencies, / Its random calls, its whispers falsely true, / Misleaders of the hooded listening soul.

06.02_109:022 - All things come to its ear but nothing abides; / All rose from the silence, all goes back to its hush.

06.02_109:023 - Its somnolence founded the universe, / Its obscure waking makes the world seem vain.

06.02_109:024 - Arisen from Nothingness and towards Nothingness turned / Its dark and potent nescience was earth’s start; / It is the waste stuff from which all was made; / Into its deeps creation can collapse.

06.02_109:025 - Its opposition clogs the march of the soul, / It is the mother of our ignorance.

06.02_109:026 - He must call light into its dark abysms, / Else never can Truth conquer Matter’s sleep / And all earth look into the eyes of God.

06.02_109:027 - All things obscure his knowledge must relume, / All things perverse his power must unknot: / He must pass to the other shore of falsehood’s sea, / He must enter the world’s dark to bring there light.

06.02_109:028 - The heart of evil must be bared to his eyes, / He must learn its cosmic dark Necessity, / Its right and its dire roots in Nature’s soil.

06.02_109:029 - He must know the thought that moves the demon act / And justifies the Titan’s erring pride / And the falsehood lurking in earth’s crooked dreams: / He must enter the eternity of Night / And know God’s darkness as he knows his Sun.

06.02_109:030 - For this he must go down into the pit, / For this he must invade the dolorous Vasts.

06.02_109:031 - Imperishable and wise and infinite, / He still must travel Hell the world to save.

06.02_109:032 - Into the eternal Light he shall emerge / On borders of the meeting of all worlds; / There on the verge of Nature’s summit steps / The secret Law of each thing is fulfilled, / All contraries heal their long dissidence.

06.02_109:033 - There meet and clasp the eternal opposites, / There pain becomes a violent fiery joy; / Evil turns back to its original good, / And sorrow lies upon the breasts of Bliss: / She has learnt to weep glad tears of happiness; / Her gaze is charged with a wistful ecstasy.

06.02_109:034 - Then shall be ended here the Law of Pain.

06.02_109:035 - Earth shall be made a home of Heaven’s light, / A seer heaven-born shall lodge in human breasts; / The superconscient beam shall touch men’s eyes / And the truth-conscious world come down to earth / Invading Matter with the Spirit’s ray / Awaking its silence to immortal thoughts, / Awaking the dumb heart to the living Word.

06.02_109:036 - This mortal life shall house Eternity’s bliss, / The body’s self taste immortality.

06.02_109:037 - Then shall the world-redeemer’s task be done.


Section I - 110


06.02_110:001 - Till then must life carry its seed of death / And sorrow’s plaint be heard in the slow Night.

06.02_110:002 - O mortal, bear this great world’s law of pain, / In thy hard passage through a suffering world / Lean for thy soul’s support on Heaven’s strength, / Turn towards high Truth, aspire to love and peace.

06.02_110:003B - A little bliss is lent thee from above, / A touch divine upon thy human days: / Make of thy daily way a pilgrimage, / For through small joys and griefs thou mov’st towards God.

06.02_110:004 - Haste not towards Godhead on a dangerous road, / Open not thy doorways to a nameless Power, / Climb not to Godhead by the Titan’s road.

06.02_110:005 - Against the Law he pits his single will, / Across its way he throws his pride of might.

06.02_110:006 - Heavenward he clambers on a stair of storms / Aspiring to live near the deathless Sun.

06.02_110:007 - He strives with a giant strength to wrest by force / From life and Nature the immortals’ right; / He takes by storm the world and fate and heaven.

06.02_110:008 - He comes not to the high world-maker’s seat, / He waits not for the outstretched hand of God / To raise him out of his mortality.

06.02_110:009 - All he would make his own, leave nothing free, / Stretching his small self to cope with the infinite.

06.02_110:010 - Obstructing the gods’ open ways he makes / His own estate of the earth’s air and light; / A monopolist of the world-energy, / He dominates the life of common men.

06.02_110:011 - His pain and others’ pain he makes his means: / On death and suffering he builds his throne.

06.02_110:012 - In the hurry and clangour of his acts of might, / In a riot and excess of fame and shame, / By his magnitudes of hate and violence, / By the quaking of the world beneath his tread / He matches himself against the Eternal’s calm / And feels in himself the greatness of a god: / Power is his image of celestial self.

06.02_110:013 - The Titan’s heart is a sea of fire and force; / He exults in the death of things and ruin and fall, / He feeds his strength with his own and others’ pain; / In the world’s pathos and passion he takes delight, / His pride, his might call for the struggle and pang.

06.02_110:014 - He glories in the sufferings of the flesh / And covers the stigmata with the Stoic’s name.

06.02_110:015 - His eyes blinded and visionless stare at the sun, / The seeker’s sight receding from his heart / Can find no more the light of eternity; / He sees the beyond as an emptiness void of soul / And takes his night for a dark infinite.

06.02_110:016 - His nature magnifies the unreal’s blank / And sees in Nought the sole reality: / He would stamp his single figure on the world, / Obsess the world’s rumours with his single name.

06.02_110:017 - His moments centre the vast universe.

06.02_110:018 - He sees his little self as very God.

06.02_110:019 - His little “I” has swallowed the whole world, / His ego has stretched into infinity.

06.02_110:020 - His mind, a beat in original Nothingness, / Ciphers his thought on a slate of hourless Time.

06.02_110:021 - He builds on a mighty vacancy of soul / A huge philosophy of Nothingness.

06.02_110:022 - In him Nirvana lives and speaks and acts / Impossibly creating a universe.

06.02_110:023 - An eternal zero is his formless self, / His spirit the void impersonal absolute.

06.02_110:024 - Take not that stride, O growing soul of man; / Cast not thy self into that night of God.

06.02_110:025 - The soul suffering is not eternity’s key, / Or ransom by sorrow, heaven’s demand on life.

06.02_110:026 - O mortal, bear, but ask not for the stroke, / Too soon will grief and anguish find thee out.

06.02_110:027 - Too enormous is that venture for thy will; / Only in limits can man’s strength be safe; / Yet is infinity thy spirit’s goal; / Its bliss is there behind the world’s face of tears.

06.02_110:028 - A power is in thee that thou knowest not; / Thou art a vessel of the imprisoned spark.

06.02_110:029 - It seeks relief from Time’s envelopment, / And while thou shutst it in, the seal is pain: / Bliss is the Godhead’s crown, eternal, free, / Unburdened by life’s blind mystery of pain: / Pain is the signature of the Ignorance / Attesting the secret god denied by life: / Until life finds him pain can never end.

06.02_110:030 - Calm is self’s victory overcoming fate.

06.02_110:031 - Bear; thou shalt find at last thy road to bliss.

06.02_110:032 - Bliss is the secret stuff of all that lives, / Even pain and grief are garbs of world-delight, / It hides behind thy sorrow and thy cry.

06.02_110:033 - Because thy strength is a part and not God’s whole, / Because afflicted by the little self / Thy consciousness forgets to be divine / As it walks in the vague penumbra of the flesh / And cannot bear the world’s tremendous touch, / Thou criest out and sayst that there is pain.

06.02_110:034 - Indifference, pain and joy, a triple disguise, / Attire of the rapturous Dancer in the ways, / Withhold from thee the body of God’s bliss.

06.02_110:035 - Thy spirit’s strength shall make thee one with God, / Thy agony shall change to ecstasy, / Indifference deepen into infinity’s calm / And joy laugh nude on the peaks of the Absolute.


Section I - 111


06.02_111:001 - O mortal who complainst of death and fate, / Accuse none of the harms thyself hast called; / This troubled world thou hast chosen for thy home, / Thou art thyself the author of thy pain.

06.02_111:002 - Once in the immortal boundlessness of Self, / In a vast of Truth and Consciousness and Light / The soul looked out from its felicity.

06.02_111:003 - It felt the Spirit’s interminable bliss, / It knew itself deathless, timeless, spaceless, one, / It saw the Eternal, lived in the Infinite.

06.02_111:004 - Then, curious of a shadow thrown by Truth, / It strained towards some otherness of self, / It was drawn to an unknown Face peering through night.

06.02_111:005 - It sensed a negative infinity, / A void supernal whose immense excess / Imitating God and everlasting Time / Offered a ground for Nature’s adverse birth / And Matter’s rigid hard unconsciousness / Harbouring the brilliance of a transient soul / That lights up birth and death and ignorant life.

06.02_111:006 - A Mind arose that stared at Nothingness / Till figures formed of what could never be; / It housed the contrary of all that is.

06.02_111:007 - A Nought appeared as Being’s huge sealed cause, / Its dumb support in a blank infinite, / In whose abysm spirit must disappear: / A darkened Nature lived and held the seed / Of Spirit hidden and feigning not to be.

06.02_111:008 - The eternal Consciousness became the home / Of some unsouled almighty Inconscient; / One breathed no more the spirit’s native air.

06.02_111:009 - A stranger in the insentient universe, / Bliss was the incident of a mortal hour.

06.02_111:010 - As one drawn by the grandeur of the Void / The soul attracted leaned to the Abyss: / It longed for the adventure of Ignorance / And the marvel and surprise of the Unknown / And the endless possibility that lurked / In the womb of Chaos and in Nothing’s gulf / Or looked from the unfathomed eyes of Chance.

06.02_111:011 - It tired of its unchanging happiness, / It turned away from immortality: / It was drawn to hazard’s call and danger’s charm, / It yearned to the pathos of grief, the drama of pain, / Perdition’s peril, the wounded bare escape, / The music of ruin and its glamour and crash, / The savour of pity and the gamble of love / And passion and the ambiguous face of Fate.

06.02_111:012 - A world of hard endeavour and difficult toil / And battle on extinction’s perilous verge, / A clash of forces, a vast incertitude, / The joy of creation out of Nothingness, / Strange meetings on the roads of Ignorance / And the companionship of half-known souls / Or the solitary greatness and lonely force / Of a separate being conquering its world, / Called it from its too safe eternity.

06.02_111:013 - A huge descent began, a giant fall: / For what the spirit sees, creates a truth / And what the soul imagines is made a world.

06.02_111:014 - A Thought that leaped from the Timeless can become, / Indicator of cosmic consequence / And the itinerary of the gods, / A cyclic movement in eternal Time.

06.02_111:015 - Thus came, born from a blind tremendous choice, / This great perplexed and discontented world, / This haunt of Ignorance, this home of Pain: / There are pitched desire’s tents, grief’s headquarters.

06.02_111:016 - A vast disguise conceals the Eternal’s bliss.



Section I - 112


06.02_112:001 - Then Aswapathy answered to the seer: / “Is then the spirit ruled by an outward world?

06.02_112:002 - O seer, is there no remedy within?

06.02_112:003 - But what is fate if not the spirit’s will / After long time fulfilled by cosmic Force?

06.02_112:004 - I deemed a mighty Power had come with her; / Is not that Power the high compeer of Fate?"

06.02_112:005 - But Narad answered covering truth with truth: / “O Aswapathy, random seem the ways / Along whose banks your footsteps stray or run / In casual hours and moments of the gods, / Yet your least stumblings are foreseen above.

06.02_112:006 - Infallibly the curves of life are drawn / Following the stream of Time through the unknown; / They are led by a clue the calm immortals keep.

06.02_112:007 - This blazoned hieroglyph of prophet moons / A meaning more sublime in symbols writes / Than sealed Thought wakes to, but of this high script / How shall my voice convince the mind of earth?

06.02_112:008 - Heaven’s wiser love rejects the mortal’s prayer; / Unblinded by the breath of his desire, / Unclouded by the mists of fear and hope, / It bends above the strife of love with death; / It keeps for her her privilege of pain.

06.02_112:009 - A greatness in thy daughter’s soul resides / That can transform herself and all around, / But must cross on stones of suffering to its goal.

06.02_112:010 - Although designed like a nectar cup of heaven, / Of heavenly ether made she sought this air, / She too must share the human need of grief / And all her cause of joy transmute to pain.

06.02_112:011 - The mind of mortal man is led by words, / His sight retires behind the walls of Thought / And looks out only through half-opened doors.

06.02_112:012 - He cuts the boundless Truth into sky-strips / And every strip he takes for all the heavens.

06.02_112:013 - He stares at infinite Possibility / And gives to the plastic Vast the name of Chance.

06.02_112:014 - He sees the long results of an all-wise Force / Planning a sequence of steps in endless Time, / But in its links imagines a senseless chain / Or the dead hand of cold Necessity; / He answers not to the mystic Mother’s heart, / Misses the ardent heavings of her breast / And feels cold rigid limbs of lifeless Law.

06.02_112:015 - The will of the Timeless working out in Time / In the free absolute steps of cosmic Truth / Appears a hard machine or meaningless Fate.

06.02_112:016 - A Magician’s formulas have made Matter’s laws / And while they last, all things by them are bound: / But the Spirit’s consent is needed for each act / And freedom walks in the same pace with Law.

06.02_112:017 - All here can change if the Magician choose.

06.02_112:018 - If human will could be made one with God’s, / If human thought could echo the thoughts of God, / Man might be all-knowing and omnipotent; / But now he walks in Nature’s doubtful ray.

06.02_112:019 - Yet can the mind of man receive God’s light, / The force of man can be driven by God’s force, / Then is he a miracle doing miracles.

06.02_112:020 - For only so can he be Nature’s King.

06.02_112:021 - It is decreed and Satyavan must die; / The hour is fixed, chosen the fatal stroke.

06.02_112:022 - What else shall be is written in her soul.

06.02_112:023 - But till the hour reveals the fateful script / The writing waits illegible and mute.

06.02_112:024 - Fate is Truth working out in Ignorance.

06.02_112:025 - O King, thy fate is a transaction done / At every hour between Nature and thy soul / With God for its foreseeing arbiter.

06.02_112:026 - Fate is a balance drawn in Destiny’s book.

06.02_112:027 - Man can accept his fate, he can refuse.

06.02_112:028 - Even if the One maintains the unseen decree / He writes thy refusal in thy credit page: / For doom is not a close, a mystic seal.

06.02_112:029 - Arisen from the tragic crash of life, / Arisen from the body’s torture and death, / The spirit rises mightier by defeat; / Its godlike wings grow wider with each fall.

06.02_112:030 - Its splendid failures sum to victory.

06.02_112:031 - O man, the events that meet thee on thy road, / Though they smite thy body and soul with joy and grief, / Are not thy fate; they touch thee awhile and pass; / Even death can cut not short thy spirit’s walk: / Thy goal, the road thou choosest are thy fate.

06.02_112:032 - On the altar throwing thy thoughts, thy heart, thy works, / Thy fate is a long sacrifice to the gods / Till they have opened to thee thy secret self / And made thee one with the indwelling God.

06.02_112:033 - O soul, intruder in Nature’s ignorance, / Armed traveller to the unseen supernal heights, / Thy spirit’s fate is a battle and ceaseless march / Against invisible opponent Powers, / A passage from Matter into timeless Self.

06.02_112:034 - Adventurer through blind unforeseeing Time, / A forced advance through a long line of lives, / It pushes its spearhead through the centuries.

06.02_112:035 - Across the dust and mire of the earthly plain, / On many-guarded lines and dangerous fronts, / In dire assaults, in wounded slow retreats, / Or holding the ideal’s battered fort / Or fighting against odds in lonely posts, / Or camped in night around the bivouac’s fires, / Awaiting the tardy trumpets of the dawn / In hunger and in plenty and in pain, / Through peril and through triumph and through fall, / Through life’s green lanes and over her desert sands, / Up the bald moor, along the sunlit ridge / In serried columns with a straggling rear / Led by its nomad vanguard’s signal fires, / Marches the army of the waylost god.

06.02_112:036 - Then late the joy ineffable is felt, / Then he remembers his forgotten self; / He has refound the skies from which he fell.

06.02_112:037 - At length his front’s indomitable line / Forces the last passes of the Ignorance: / Advancing beyond Nature’s last known bounds, / Reconnoitring the formidable unknown, / Beyond the landmarks of things visible, / It mounts through a miraculous upper air / Till climbing the mute summit of the world / He stands upon the splendour-peaks of God.

06.02_112:038 - In vain thou mournst that Satyavan must die; / His death is a beginning of greater life, / Death is the spirit’s opportunity.

06.02_112:039 - A vast intention has brought the souls close / And love and death conspire towards one great end.

06.02_112:040 - For out of danger and pain heaven-bliss shall come, / Time’s unforeseeing event, God’s secret plan.

06.02_112:041 - This world was not built with random bricks of chance, / A blind god is not destiny’s architect; / A conscious power has drawn the plan of life, / There is a meaning in each curve and line.

06.02_112:042 - It is an architecture high and grand / By many named and nameless masons built / In which unseeing hands obey the Unseen, / And of its master-builders she is one.

06.02_112:043 - Queen, strive no more to change the secret will; / Time’s accidents are steps in its vast scheme.

06.02_112:044 - Bring not thy brief and helpless human tears / Across the fathomless moments of a heart / That knows its single will and God’s as one: / It can embrace its hostile destiny; / It sits apart with grief and facing death, / Affronting adverse fate armed and alone.

06.02_112:045 - In this enormous world standing apart / In the mightiness of her silent spirit’s will, / In the passion of her soul of sacrifice / Her lonely strength facing the universe, / Affronting fate, asks not man’s help nor god’s: / Sometimes one life is charged with earth’s destiny, / It cries not for succour from the time-bound powers.

06.02_112:046 - Alone she is equal to her mighty task.

06.02_112:047 - Intervene not in a strife too great for thee, / A struggle too deep for mortal thought to sound, / Its question to this Nature’s rigid bounds / When the soul fronts nude of garbs the infinite, / Its too vast theme of a lonely mortal will / Pacing the silence of eternity.

06.02_112:048 - As a star, uncompanioned, moves in heaven / Unastonished by the immensities of space, / Travelling infinity by its own light, / The great are strongest when they stand alone.

06.02_112:049 - A God-given might of being is their force, / A ray from self’s solitude of light the guide; / The soul that can live alone with itself meets God; / Its lonely universe is their rendezvous.

06.02_112:050 - A day may come when she must stand unhelped / On a dangerous brink of the world’s doom and hers.

06.02_112:051 - Carrying the world’s future on her lonely breast, / Carrying the human hope in a heart left sole / To conquer or fail on a last desperate verge; / Alone with death and close to extinction’s edge, / Her single greatness in that last dire scene, / She must cross alone a perilous bridge in Time / And reach an apex of world-destiny / Where all is won or all is lost for man.

06.02_112:052 - In that tremendous silence lone and lost / Of a deciding hour in the world’s fate, / In her soul’s climbing beyond mortal time / When she stands sole with Death or sole with God / Apart upon a silent desperate brink / Alone with her self and death and destiny / As on some verge between Time and Timelessness / When being must end or life rebuild its base, / Alone she must conquer or alone must fall.

06.02_112:053 - No human aid can reach her in that hour, / No armoured God stand shining at her side.

06.02_112:054 - Cry not to heaven, for she alone can save.

06.02_112:055 - For this the silent Force came missioned down; / In her the conscious Will took human shape: / She only can save herself and save the world.

06.02_112:056 - O queen, stand back from that stupendous scene, / Come not between her and her hour of Fate.

06.02_112:057 - Her hour must come and none can intervene: / Think not to turn her from her heaven-sent task, / Strive not to save her from her own high will.

06.02_112:058 - Thou hast no place in that tremendous strife; / Thy love and longing are not arbiters there, / Leave the world’s fate and her to God’s sole guard.

06.02_112:059 - Even if he seems to leave her to her lone strength, / Even though all falters and falls and sees an end / And the heart fails and only are death and night, / God-given her strength can battle against doom / Even on a brink where Death alone seems close / And no human strength can hinder or can help.

06.02_112:060 - Think not to intercede with the hidden Will, / Intrude not twixt her spirit and its force / But leave her to her mighty self and Fate."



Section I - 113: and left the earthly scene


06.02_113:001 - He spoke and ceased and left the earthly scene.

06.02_113:002 - Away from the strife and suffering on our globe, / He turned towards his far-off blissful home.

06.02_113:003 - A brilliant arrow pointing straight to heaven, / The luminous body of the eternal seer / Assailed the purple glory of the noon / And disappeared like a receding star / Vanishing into the light of the Unseen; / But still a cry was heard in the infinite, / And still to the listening soul on mortal earth / A high and far imperishable voice / Chanted the anthem of eternal love.



Canto Book7 - 7: THE BOOK OF YOGA

Canto 1 - 7.1: The Joy of Union; the Ordeal of the Foreknowledge of Death and the Heart's Grief and Pain

Section I - 114: all pur behind her


07.01_114:001 - Fate followed her foreseen immutable road.

07.01_114:002 - Man’s hopes and longings build the journeying wheels / That bear the body of his destiny / And lead his blind will towards an unknown goal.

07.01_114:003 - His fate within him shapes his acts and rules; / Its face and form already are born in him, / Its parentage is in his secret soul; / Here Matter seems to mould the body’s life / And the soul follows where its nature drives: / Nature and Fate compel his free-will’s choice.

07.01_114:004 - But greater spirits this balance can reverse / And make the soul the artist of its fate.

07.01_114:005 - This is the mystic truth our ignorance hides: / Doom is a passage for our inborn force, / Our ordeal is the hidden spirit’s choice, / Ananke is our being’s own decree.

07.01_114:006 - All was fulfilled the heart of Savitri / Flower-sweet and adamant, passionate and calm, / Had chosen and on her strength’s unbending road / Forced to its issue the long cosmic curve.

07.01_114:007 - Once more she sat behind loud hastening hooves; / A speed of armoured squadrons and a voice / Far-heard of chariots bore her from her home.

07.01_114:008 - A couchant earth wakened in its dumb muse / Looked up at her from a vast indolence: / Hills wallowing in a bright haze, large lands / That lolled at ease beneath the summer heavens, / Region on region spacious in the sun, / Cities like chrysolites in the wide blaze / And yellow rivers pacing, lion-maned, / Led to the Shalwa marches’ emerald line, / A happy front to iron vastnesses / And austere peaks and titan solitudes.

07.01_114:009 - Once more was near the fair and fated place, / The borders gleaming with the groves’ delight / Where first she met the face of Satyavan / And he saw like one waking into a dream / Some timeless beauty and reality, / The moon-gold sweetness of heaven’s earth-born child.

07.01_114:010 - The past receded and the future neared: / Far now behind lay Madra’s spacious halls, / The white carved pillars, the cool dim alcoves, / The tinged mosaic of the crystal floors, / The towered pavilions, the wind-rippled pools / And gardens humming with the murmur of bees, / Forgotten soon or a pale memory / The fountain’s plash in the wide stone-bound pool, / The thoughtful noontide’s brooding solemn trance, / The colonnade’s dream grey in the quiet eve, / The slow moonrise gliding in front of Night.

07.01_114:011 - Left far behind were now the faces known, / The happy silken babble on laughter’s lips / And the close-clinging clasp of intimate hands / And adoration’s light in cherished eyes / Offered to the one sovereign of their life.

07.01_114:012 - Nature’s primeval loneliness was here: / Here only was the voice of bird and beast,— / The ascetic’s exile in the dim-souled huge / Inhuman forest far from cheerful sound / Of man’s blithe converse and his crowded days.

07.01_114:013 - In a broad eve with one red eye of cloud, / Through a narrow opening, a green flowered cleft, / Out of the stare of sky and soil they came / Into a mighty home of emerald dusk.

07.01_114:014 - There onward led by a faint brooding path / Which toiled through the shadow of enormous trunks / And under arches misers of sunshine, / They saw low thatched roofs of a hermitage / Huddled beneath a patch of azure hue / In a sunlit clearing that seemed the outbreak / Of a glad smile in the forest’s monstrous heart, / A rude refuge of the thought and will of man / Watched by the crowding giants of the wood.

07.01_114:015 - Arrived in that rough-hewn homestead they gave, / Questioning no more the strangeness of her fate, / Their pride and loved one to the great blind king, / A regal pillar of fallen mightiness / And the stately care-worn woman once a queen / Who now hoped nothing for herself from life, / But all things only hoped for her one child, / Calling on that single head from partial Fate / All joy of earth, all heaven’s beatitude.

07.01_114:016 - Adoring wisdom and beauty like a young god’s, / She saw him loved by heaven as by herself, / She rejoiced in his brightness and believed in his fate / And knew not of the evil drawing near.

07.01_114:017 - Lingering some days upon the forest verge / Like men who lengthen out departure’s pain, / Unwilling to separate sorrowful clinging hands, / Unwilling to see for the last time a face, / Heavy with the sorrow of a coming day / And wondering at the carelessness of Fate / Who breaks with idle hands her supreme works, / They parted from her with pain-fraught burdened hearts / As forced by inescapable fate we part / From one whom we shall never see again; / Driven by the singularity of her fate, / Helpless against the choice of Savitri’s heart / They left her to her rapture and her doom / In the tremendous forest’s savage charge.

07.01_114:018 - All put behind her that was once her life, / All welcomed that henceforth was his and hers, / She abode with Satyavan in the wild woods: / Priceless she deemed her joy so close to death; / Apart with love she lived for love alone.

07.01_114:019 - As if self-poised above the march of days, / Her immobile spirit watched the haste of Time, / A statue of passion and invincible force, / An absolutism of sweet imperious will, / A tranquillity and a violence of the gods / Indomitable and immutable.


Section I - 115: clouds shut in the earth


07.01_115:001 - At first to her beneath the sapphire heavens / The sylvan solitude was a gorgeous dream, / An altar of the summer’s splendour and fire, / A sky-topped flower-hung palace of the gods / And all its scenes a smile on rapture’s lips / And all its voices bards of happiness.

07.01_115:002 - There was a chanting in the casual wind, / There was a glory in the least sunbeam; / Night was a chrysoprase on velvet cloth, / A nestling darkness or a moonlit deep; / Day was a purple pageant and a hymn, / A wave of the laughter of light from morn to eve.

07.01_115:003 - His absence was a dream of memory, / His presence was the empire of a god.

07.01_115:004 - A fusing of the joys of earth and heaven, / A tremulous blaze of nuptial rapture passed, / A rushing of two spirits to be one, / A burning of two bodies in one flame.

07.01_115:005 - Opened were gates of unforgettable bliss: / Two lives were locked within an earthly heaven / And fate and grief fled from that fiery hour.

07.01_115:006 - But soon now failed the summer’s ardent breath / And throngs of blue-black clouds crept through the sky / And rain fled sobbing over the dripping leaves / And storm became the forest’s titan voice.

07.01_115:007 - Then listening to the thunder’s fatal crash / And the fugitive pattering footsteps of the showers / And the long unsatisfied panting of the wind / And sorrow muttering in the sound-vexed night, / The grief of all the world came near to her: / Night’s darkness seemed her future’s ominous face.

07.01_115:008 - The shadow of her lover’s doom arose / And fear laid hands upon her mortal heart.

07.01_115:009 - The moments swift and ruthless raced; alarmed / Her thoughts, her mind remembered Narad’s date.

07.01_115:010 - A trembling moved accountant of her riches, / She reckoned the insufficient days between: / A dire expectancy knocked at her breast; / Dreadful to her were the footsteps of the hours: / Grief came, a passionate stranger to her gate: / Banished when in his arms, out of her sleep / It rose at morn to look into her face.

07.01_115:011 - Vainly she fled into abysms of bliss / From her pursuing foresight of the end.

07.01_115:012 - The more she plunged into love that anguish grew; / Her deepest grief from sweetest gulfs arose.

07.01_115:013 - Remembrance was a poignant pang, she felt / Each day a golden leaf torn cruelly out / From her too slender book of love and joy.

07.01_115:014 - Thus swaying in strong gusts of happiness, / And swimming in foreboding’s sombre waves, / And feeding sorrow and terror with her heart,— / For now they sat among her bosom’s guests / Or in her inner chamber paced apart,— / Her eyes stared blind into the future’s night.

07.01_115:015 - Out of her separate self she looked and saw, / Moving amid the unconscious faces loved, / In mind a stranger though in heart so near, / The ignorant smiling world go happily by / Upon its way towards an unknown doom / And wondered at the careless lives of men.

07.01_115:016 - As if in different worlds they walked, though close, / They confident of the returning sun, / They wrapped in little hourly hopes and tasks,— / She in her dreadful knowledge was alone.

07.01_115:017 - The rich and happy secrecy that once / Enshrined her as if in a silver bower / Apart in a bright nest of thoughts and dreams / Made room for tragic hours of solitude / And lonely grief that none could share or know, / A body seeing the end too soon of joy / And the fragile happiness of its mortal love.

07.01_115:018 - Her quiet visage still and sweet and calm, / Her graceful daily acts were now a mask; / In vain she looked upon her depths to find / A ground of stillness and the spirit’s peace.

07.01_115:019 - Still veiled from her was the silent Being within / Who sees life’s drama pass with unmoved eyes, / Supports the sorrow of the mind and heart / And bears in human breasts the world and fate.

07.01_115:020 - A glimpse or flashes came, the Presence was hid.

07.01_115:021 - Only her violent heart and passionate will / Were pushed in front to meet the immutable doom; / Defenceless, nude, bound to her human lot / They had no means to act, no way to save.

07.01_115:022 - These she controlled, nothing was shown outside: / She was still to them the child they knew and loved; / The sorrowing woman they saw not within; / No change was in her beautiful motions seen: / A worshipped empress all once vied to serve, / She made herself the diligent serf of all, / Nor spared the labour of broom and jar and well, / Or close gentle tending or to heap the fire / Of altar and kitchen, no slight task allowed / To others that her woman’s strength might do.

07.01_115:023 - In all her acts a strange divinity shone: / Into a simplest movement she could bring / A oneness with earth’s glowing robe of light, / A lifting up of common acts by love.

07.01_115:024 - All-love was hers and its one heavenly cord, / Bound all to all with her as golden tie.

07.01_115:025 - But when her grief to the surface pressed too close, / These things, once gracious adjuncts of her joy, / Seemed meaningless to her, a gleaming shell, / Or were a round mechanical and void, / Her body’s actions shared not by her will.

07.01_115:026 - Always behind this strange divided life / Her spirit like a sea of living fire / Possessed her lover and to his body clung, / One locked embrace to guard its threatened mate.

07.01_115:027 - All night she woke through the slow silent hours / Brooding on the treasure of his bosom and face, / Hung o’er the sleep-bound beauty of his brow / Or laid her burning cheek upon his feet.

07.01_115:028 - Waking at morn her lips endlessly clung to his, / Unwilling ever to separate again / Or lose that honeyed drain of lingering joy, / Unwilling to loose his body from her breast, / The warm inadequate signs that love must use.

07.01_115:029 - Intolerant of the poverty of Time / Her passion catching at the fugitive hours / Willed the expense of centuries in one day / Of prodigal love and the surf of ecstasy; / Or else she strove even in mortal time / To build a little room for timelessness / By the deep union of two human lives, / Her soul secluded shut into his soul.

07.01_115:030 - After all was given she demanded still; / Even by his strong embrace unsatisfied, / She longed to cry, “O tender Satyavan, / O lover of my soul, give more, give more / Of love while yet thou canst, to her thou lovst.

07.01_115:031 - Imprint thyself for every nerve to keep / That thrills to thee the message of my heart.

07.01_115:032 - For soon we part and who shall know how long / Before the great wheel in its monstrous round / Restore us to each other and our love?"

07.01_115:033 - Too well she loved to speak a fateful word / And lay her burden on his happy head; / She pressed the outsurging grief back into her breast / To dwell within silent, unhelped, alone.

07.01_115:034 - But Satyavan sometimes half understood, / Or felt at least with the uncertain answer / Of our thought-blinded hearts the unuttered need, / The unplumbed abyss of her deep passionate want.

07.01_115:035 - All of his speeding days that he could spare / From labour in the forest hewing wood / And hunting food in the wild sylvan glades / And service to his father’s sightless life / He gave to her and helped to increase the hours / By the nearness of his presence and his clasp, / And lavish softness of heart-seeking words / And the close beating felt of heart on heart.

07.01_115:036 - All was too little for her bottomless need.

07.01_115:037 - If in his presence she forgot awhile, / Grief filled his absence with its aching touch, / She saw the desert of her coming days / Imaged in every solitary hour.

07.01_115:038 - Although with a vain imaginary bliss / Of fiery union through death’s door of escape / She dreamed of her body robed in funeral flame, / She knew she must not clutch that happiness / To die with him and follow, seizing his robe / Across our other countries, travellers glad / Into the sweet or terrible Beyond.

07.01_115:039 - For those sad parents still would need her here / To help the empty remnant of their day.

07.01_115:040 - Often it seemed to her the ages’ pain / Had pressed their quintessence into her single woe / Concentrating in her a tortured world.

07.01_115:041 - Thus in the silent chamber of her soul / Cloistering her love to live with secret grief / She dwelt like a dumb priest with hidden gods / Unappeased by the wordless offering of her days, / Lifting to them her sorrow like frankincense, / Her life the altar, herself the sacrifice.

07.01_115:042 - Yet ever they grew into each other more / Until it seemed no power could rend apart, / Since even the body’s walls could not divide.

07.01_115:043 - For when he wandered in the forest, oft / Her conscious spirit walked with him and knew / His actions as if in herself he moved; / He, less aware, thrilled with her from afar.

07.01_115:044 - Always the stature of her passion grew; / Grief, fear became the food of mighty love.

07.01_115:045 - Increased by its torment it filled the whole world, / It was all her life, became her whole earth and heaven.

07.01_115:046 - Although life-born, an infant of the hours, / Immortal it walked unslayable as the gods: / Her spirit stretched measureless in strength divine / An anvil for the blows of Fate and Time: / Or tired of sorrow’s passionate luxury, / Grief’s self became calm, dull-eyed, resolute / Awaiting some issue of its fiery struggle, / Some deed in which it might for ever cease, / Victorious over itself and death and tears.

07.01_115:047 - The year now paused upon the brink of change.

07.01_115:048 - No more the storms sailed with stupendous wings / And thunder strode in wrath across the world, / And still was heard a muttering in the sky / And rain dripped wearily through the mournful air / And grey slow-drifting clouds shut in the earth.

07.01_115:049 - So her grief’s heavy sky shut in her heart.

07.01_115:050 - A still self hid behind but gave no light: / No voice came down from the forgotten heights; / Only in the privacy of its brooding pain / Her human heart spoke to the body’s fate.


Canto 2 - 7.2: The Parable of the Search for the Soul

Section I - 116: all things shall fold thee


07.02_116:001 - As in the vigilance of the sleepless night / Through the slow heavy-footed silent hours, / Repressing in her bosom its load of grief, / She sat staring at the dumb tread of Time / And the approach of ever-nearing Fate, / A summons from her being’s summit came, / A sound, a call that broke the seals of Night.

07.02_116:002 - Above her brows where will and knowledge meet / A mighty Voice invaded mortal space.

07.02_116:003 - It seemed to come from inaccessible heights / And yet was intimate with all the world / And knew the meaning of the steps of Time / And saw eternal destiny’s changeless scene / Filling the far prospect of the cosmic gaze.

07.02_116:004 - As the Voice touched, her body became a stark / And rigid golden statue of motionless trance, / A stone of God lit by an amethyst soul.

07.02_116:005 - Around her body’s stillness all grew still: / Her heart listened to its slow measured beats, / Her mind renouncing thought heard and was mute: / “Why camest thou to this dumb deathbound earth, / This ignorant life beneath indifferent skies / Tied like a sacrifice on the altar of Time, / O spirit, O immortal energy, / If ’twas to nurse grief in a helpless heart / Or with hard tearless eyes awake thy doom?

07.02_116:006 - Arise, O soul, and vanquish Time and Death."

07.02_116:007 - But Savitri’s heart replied in the dim night: / “My strength is taken from me and given to Death, / Why should I lift my hands to the shut heavens / Or struggle with mute inevitable Fate / Or hope in vain to uplift an ignorant race / Who hug their lot and mock the saviour Light / And see in Mind Wisdom’s sole tabernacle, / In its harsh peak and its inconscient base / A rock of safety and an anchor of sleep?

07.02_116:008 - Is there a God whom any cry can move?

07.02_116:009 - He sits in peace and leaves the mortal’s strength / Impotent against his calm omnipotent Law / And Inconscience and the almighty hands of Death.

07.02_116:010 - What need have I, what need has Satyavan / To avoid the black meshed net, the dismal door, / Or call a mightier Light into life’s closed room, / A greater Law into man’s little world?

07.02_116:011 - Why should I strive with earth’s unyielding laws / Or stave off death’s inevitable hour?

07.02_116:012 - This surely is best to pactise with my fate / And follow close behind my lover’s steps / And pass through night from twilight to the sun / Across the tenebrous river that divides / The adjoining parishes of earth and heaven.

07.02_116:013 - Then could we lie inarmed breast upon breast, / Untroubled by thought, untroubled by our hearts, / Forgetting man and life and time and its hours, / Forgetting eternity’s call, forgetting God."

07.02_116:014 - The Voice replied: “Is this enough, O spirit?

07.02_116:015 - And what shall thy soul say when it wakes and knows / The work was left undone for which it came?

07.02_116:016 - Or is this all for thy being born on earth / Charged with a mandate from eternity, / A listener to the voices of the years, / A follower of the footprints of the gods, / To pass and leave unchanged the old dusty laws?

07.02_116:017 - Shall there be no new tables, no new Word, / No greater light come down upon the earth / Delivering her from her unconsciousness, / Man’s spirit from unalterable fate?

07.02_116:018 - Cam’st thou not down to open the doors of Fate, / The iron doors that seemed for ever closed, / And lead man to truth’s wide and golden road / That runs through finite things to eternity?

07.02_116:019 - Is this then the report that I must make, / My head bowed with shame before the Eternal’s seat,— / His power he kindled in thy body has failed, / His labourer returns, her task undone?"

07.02_116:020 - Then Savitri’s heart fell mute, it spoke no word.

07.02_116:021 - But holding back her troubled rebel heart, / Abrupt, erect and strong, calm like a hill, / Surmounting the seas of mortal ignorance, / Its peak immutable above mind’s air, / A Power within her answered the still Voice: / “I am thy portion here charged with thy work, / As thou myself seated for ever above, / Speak to my depths, O great and deathless Voice, / Command, for I am here to do thy will."

07.02_116:022B - The Voice replied: “Remember why thou cam’st: / Find out thy soul, recover thy hid self, / In silence seek God’s meaning in thy depths, / Then mortal nature change to the divine.

07.02_116:023 - Open God’s door, enter into his trance.

07.02_116:024 - Cast Thought from thee, that nimble ape of Light: / In his tremendous hush stilling thy brain / His vast Truth wake within and know and see.

07.02_116:025 - Cast from thee sense that veils thy spirit’s sight: / In the enormous emptiness of thy mind / Thou shalt see the Eternal’s body in the world, / Know him in every voice heard by thy soul: / In the world’s contacts meet his single touch; / All things shall fold thee into his embrace.

07.02_116:026 - Conquer thy heart’s throbs, let thy heart beat in God: / Thy nature shall be the engine of his works, / Thy voice shall house the mightiness of his Word: / Then shalt thou harbour my force and conquer Death."

07.02_116:027 - Then Savitri by her doomed husband sat, / Still rigid in her golden motionless pose, / A statue of the fire of the inner sun.

07.02_116:028 - In the black night the wrath of storm swept by, / The thunder crashed above her, the rain hissed, / Its million footsteps pattered on the roof.

07.02_116:029 - Impassive mid the movement and the cry, / Witness of the thoughts of mind, the moods of life, / She looked into herself and sought for her soul.



Section I - 117: the householder helpless


07.02_117:001 - A dream disclosed to her the cosmic past, / The crypt-seed and the mystic origins, / The shadowy beginnings of world-fate: / A lamp of symbol lighting hidden truth / Imaged to her the world’s significance.

07.02_117:002 - In the indeterminate formlessness of Self / Creation took its first mysterious steps, / It made the body’s shape a house of soul / And Matter learned to think and person grew; / She saw Space peopled with the seeds of life / And saw the human creature born in Time.

07.02_117:003 - At first appeared a dim half-neutral tide / Of being emerging out of infinite Nought: / A consciousness looked at the inconscient Vast / And pleasure and pain stirred in the insensible Void.

07.02_117:004 - All was the deed of a blind World-Energy: / Unconscious of her own exploits she worked, / Shaping a universe out of the Inane.

07.02_117:005 - In fragmentary beings she grew aware: / A chaos of little sensibilities / Gathered round a small ego’s pinpoint head; / In it a sentient creature found its poise, / It moved and lived a breathing, thinking whole.

07.02_117:006 - On a dim ocean of subconscient life / A formless surface consciousness awoke: / A stream of thoughts and feelings came and went, / A foam of memories hardened and became / A bright crust of habitual sense and thought, / A seat of living personality / And recurrent habits mimicked permanence.

07.02_117:007 - Mind nascent laboured out a mutable form, / It built a mobile house on shifting sands, / A floating isle upon a bottomless sea.

07.02_117:008 - A conscious being was by this labour made; / It looked around it on its difficult field / In the green wonderful and perilous earth; / It hoped in a brief body to survive, / Relying on Matter’s false eternity.

07.02_117:009 - It felt a godhead in its fragile house; / It saw blue heavens, dreamed immortality.

07.02_117:010 - A conscious soul in the Inconscient’s world / Hidden behind our thoughts and hopes and dreams, / An indifferent Master signing Nature’s acts / Leaves the vicegerent mind a seeming king.

07.02_117:011 - In his floating house upon the sea of Time / This regent sits at work and never rests: / He is a puppet of the dance of Time; / He is driven by the hours, the moment’s call / Compels him with the thronging of life’s need / And the babel of the voices of the world.

07.02_117:012 - This mind no silence knows nor dreamless sleep, / In the incessant circling of its steps / Thoughts tread for ever through the listening brain; / It toils like a machine and cannot stop.

07.02_117:013 - Into the body’s many-storeyed rooms / Endless crowd down the dream-god’s messages.

07.02_117:014 - All is a hundred-toned murmur and babble and stir, / There is a tireless running to and fro, / A haste of movement and a ceaseless cry, / The hurried servant senses answer apace / To every knock upon the outer doors, / Bring in life’s visitors, report each call, / Admit the thousand queries and the calls / And the messages of communicating minds / And the heavy business of unnumbered lives / And all the thousandfold commerce of the world.

07.02_117:015 - Even in the tracts of sleep is scant repose; / He mocks life’s steps in strange subconscient dreams, / He strays in a sublime realm of symbol scenes, / His night with thin-air visions and dim forms / He packs or peoples with slight drifting shapes / And only a moment spends in silent self.

07.02_117:016 - Adventuring into infinite mind-space / He unfolds his wings of thought in inner air, / Or travelling in imagination’s car / Crosses the globe, journeys beneath the stars, / To subtle worlds takes his ethereal course, / Visits the gods on life’s miraculous peaks, / Communicates with Heaven, tampers with Hell.

07.02_117:017 - This is the little surface of man’s life.

07.02_117:018 - He is this and he is all the universe; / He scales the Unseen, his depths dare the Abyss; / A whole mysterious world is locked within.

07.02_117:019 - Unknown to himself lives a hidden king / Behind rich tapestries in great secret rooms; / An epicure of the spirit’s unseen joys, / He lives on the sweet honey of solitude: / A nameless god in an unapproachable fane, / In the secret adytum of his inmost soul / He guards the being’s covered mysteries / Beneath the threshold behind shadowy gates / Or shut in vast cellars of inconscient sleep.

07.02_117:020 - The immaculate Divine All-Wonderful / Casts into the argent purity of his soul / His splendour and his greatness and the light / Of self-creation in Time’s infinity / As into a sublimely mirroring glass.

07.02_117:021 - Man in the world’s life works out the dreams of God.

07.02_117:022 - But all is there, even God’s opposites; / He is a little front of Nature’s works, / A thinking outline of a cryptic Force.

07.02_117:023 - All she reveals in him that is in her, / Her glories walk in him and her darknesses.

07.02_117:024 - Man’s house of life holds not the gods alone: / There are occult Shadows, there are tenebrous Powers, / Inhabitants of life’s ominous nether rooms, / A shadowy world’s stupendous denizens.

07.02_117:025 - A careless guardian of his nature’s powers, / Man harbours dangerous forces in his house.

07.02_117:026 - The Titan and the Fury and the Djinn / Lie bound in the subconscient’s cavern pit / And the Beast grovels in his antre den: / Dire mutterings rise and murmur in their drowse.

07.02_117:027 - Insurgent sometimes raises its huge head / A monstrous mystery lurking in life’s deeps, / The mystery of dark and fallen worlds, / The dread visages of the adversary Kings.

07.02_117:028 - The dreadful powers held down within his depths / Become his masters or his ministers; / Enormous they invade his bodily house, / Can act in his acts, infest his thought and life.

07.02_117:029 - Inferno surges into the human air / And touches all with a perverting breath.

07.02_117:030 - Grey forces like a thin miasma creep / Stealing through chinks in his closed mansion’s doors, / Discolouring the walls of upper mind / In which he lives his fair and specious life, / And leave behind a stench of sin and death: / Not only rise in him perverse drifts of thought / And formidable formless influences, / But there come presences and awful shapes: / Tremendous forms and faces mount dim steps / And stare at times into his living-rooms, / Or called up for a moment’s passionate work / Lay a dire custom’s claim upon his heart: / Aroused from sleep, they can be bound no more.

07.02_117:031 - Afflicting the daylight and alarming night, / Invading at will his outer tenement / The stark gloom’s grisly dire inhabitants / Mounting into God’s light all light perturb.

07.02_117:032t - All they have touched or seen they make their own, / In Nature’s basement lodge, mind’s passages fill, / Disrupt thought’s links and musing sequences, / Break through the soul’s stillness with a noise and cry / Or they call the inhabitants of the abyss, / Invite the instincts to forbidden joys, / A laughter wake of dread demoniac mirth / And with nether riot and revel shake life’s floor. #cost-of-desire #dark-truths #inner-darkness #natures-defense #obstacles-to-truth #shadow-work #the-ignorance

07.02_117:033 - Impotent to quell his terrible prisoners / Appalled the householder helpless sits above, / Taken from him his house is his no more.

07.02_117:034 - He is bound and forced, a victim of the play, / Or, allured, joys in the mad and mighty din.

07.02_117:035 - His nature’s dangerous forces have arisen / And hold at will a rebel’s holiday.

07.02_117:036 - Aroused from the darkness where they crouched in the depths, / Prisoned from the sight, they can be held no more; / His nature’s impulses are now his lords.

07.02_117:037 - Once quelled or wearing specious names and vests / Infernal elements, demon powers are there.

07.02_117:038 - Man’s lower nature hides these awful guests.

07.02_117:039 - Their vast contagion grips sometimes man’s world.

07.02_117:040 - An awful insurgence overpowers man’s soul.

07.02_117:041 - In house and house the huge uprising grows; / Hell’s companies are loosed to do their work, / Into the earth-ways they break out from all doors, / Invade with blood-lust and the will to slay / And fill with horror and carnage God’s fair world.

07.02_117:042 - Death and his hunters stop a victim earth; / The terrible Angel smites at every door: / An awful laughter mocks at the world’s pain / And massacre and torture grin at Heaven: / All is the prey of the destroying force; / Creation rocks and tremble top and base.

07.02_117:043 - This evil Nature housed in human hearts / A foreign inhabitant, a dangerous guest: / The soul that harbours it it can dislodge, / Expel the householder, possess the house.

07.02_117:044 - An opposite potency contradicting God, / A momentary Evil’s almightiness / Has straddled the straight path of Nature’s acts.

07.02_117:045 - It imitates the Godhead it denies, / Puts on his figure and assumes his face.

07.02_117:046 - A Manichean creator and destroyer, / This can abolish man, annul his world.

07.02_117:047 - But there is a guardian power, there are Hands that save, / Calm eyes divine regard the human scene.

07.02_117:048 - All the world’s possibilities in man / Are waiting as the tree waits in its seed: / His past lives in him; it drives his future’s pace; / His present’s acts fashion his coming fate.

07.02_117:049 - The unborn gods hide in his house of Life.

07.02_117:050 - The daemons of the unknown overshadow his mind / Casting their dreams into live moulds of thought, / The moulds in which his mind builds out its world.

07.02_117:051 - His mind creates around him its universe.

07.02_117:052 - All that has been renews in him its birth, / All that can be is figured in his soul.

07.02_117:053 - Issuing in deeds it scores on the roads of the world, / Obscure to the interpreting reason’s guess, / Lines of the secret purpose of the gods.

07.02_117:054 - In strange directions runs the intricate plan; / Held back from human foresight is their end.

07.02_117:055 - And the far intention of some ordering Will / Or the order of life’s arbitrary Chance / Finds out its settled poise and fated hour.

07.02_117:056 - Our surface watched in vain by reason’s gaze, / Invaded by the impromptus of the unseen, / Helpless records the accidents of Time, / The involuntary turns and leaps of life.

07.02_117:057 - Only a little of us foresees its steps, / Only a little has will and purposed pace.

07.02_117:058 - A vast subliminal is man’s measureless part.

07.02_117:059 - The dim subconscient is his cavern base.

07.02_117:060 - Abolished vainly in the walks of Time / Our past lives still in our unconscious selves / And by the weight of its hidden influences / Is shaped our future’s self-discovery.

07.02_117:061 - Thus all is an inevitable chain / And yet a series seems of accidents.

07.02_117:062 - The unremembering hours repeat the old acts, / Our dead past round our future’s ankles clings / And drags back the new nature’s glorious stride, / Or from its buried corpse old ghosts arise, / Old thoughts, old longings, dead passions live again, / Recur in sleep or move the waking man / To words that force the barrier of the lips, / To deeds that suddenly start and o’erleap / His head of reason and his guardian will.

07.02_117:063 - An old self lurks in the new self we are; / Hardly we escape from what we once had been: / In the dim gleam of habit’s passages, / In the subconscient’s darkling corridors / All things are carried by the porter nerves / And nothing checked by subterranean mind, / Unstudied by the guardians of the doors, / And passed by a blind instinctive memory, / The old gang dismissed, old cancelled passports serve, / Nothing is wholly dead that once had lived.

07.02_117:064 - In dim tunnels of the world’s being and in ours / The old rejected nature still survives; / The corpses of its slain thoughts raise their heads / And visit mind’s nocturnal walks in sleep, / Its stifled impulses breathe and move and rise; / All keeps a phantom immortality.

07.02_117:065 - Irresistible are Nature’s sequences: / The seeds of sins renounced sprout from hid soil; / The evil cast from our hearts once more we face.

07.02_117:066 - Our dead selves come to slay our living soul.

07.02_117:067 - A portion of us lives in present Time, / A secret mass in dim inconscience gropes; / Out of the inconscient and subliminal / Arisen, we live in mind’s uncertain light / And strive to know and master a dubious world / Whose purpose and meaning are hidden from our sight.

07.02_117:068 - Above us dwells a superconscient god / Hidden in the mystery of his own light: / Around us is a vast of ignorance / Lit by the uncertain ray of human mind, / Below us sleeps the Inconscient dark and mute.

07.02_117:069 - But this is only Matter’s first self-view, / A scale and series in the Ignorance.

07.02_117:070 - This is not all we are or all our world.

07.02_117:071 - Our greater self of knowledge waits for us, / A supreme light in the truth-conscious Vast: / It sees from summits beyond thinking mind, / It moves in a splendid air transcending life.

07.02_117:072 - It shall descend and make earth’s life divine.

07.02_117:073 - Truth made the world, not a blind Nature-Force.

07.02_117:074 - For here are not our large diviner heights; / Our summits in the superconscient’s blaze / Are glorious with the very face of God: / There is our aspect of eternity, / There is the figure of the god we are, / His young unaging look on deathless things, / His joy in our escape from death and Time, / His immortality and light and bliss.

07.02_117:075 - Our larger being sits behind cryptic walls: / There are greatnesses hidden in our unseen parts / That wait their hour to step into life’s front: / We feel an aid from deep indwelling Gods: / One speaks within, Light comes to us from above.

07.02_117:076 - Our soul from its mysterious chamber acts; / Its influence pressing on our heart and mind / Pushes them to exceed their mortal selves.

07.02_117:077 - It seeks for Good and Beauty and for God; / We see beyond self’s walls our limitless self, / We gaze through our world’s glass at half-seeing vasts, / We hunt for the Truth behind apparent things.

07.02_117:078 - Our inner Mind dwells in a larger light, / Its brightness looks at us through hidden doors; / Our members luminous grow and Wisdom’s face / Appears in the doorway of the mystic ward: / When she enters into our house of outward sense, / Then we look up and see, above, her sun.

07.02_117:079 - A mighty life-self with its inner powers / Supports the dwarfish modicum we call life; / It can graft upon our crawl two puissant wings.

07.02_117:080 - Our body’s subtle self is throned within / In its viewless palace of veridical dreams / That are bright shadows of the thoughts of God.

07.02_117:081 - In the prone obscure beginnings of the race / The human grew in the bowed apelike man.

07.02_117:082 - He stood erect, a Godlike form and force / And a soul’s thoughts looked out from earthborn eyes; / Man stood erect, he wore the thinker’s brow: / He looked at heaven and saw his comrade stars; / A vision came of beauty and greater birth / Slowly emerging from the heart’s chapel of light / And moved in a white lucent air of dreams.

07.02_117:083 - He saw his being’s unrealised vastnesses, / He aspired and housed the nascent demi-god.

07.02_117:084 - Out of the dim recesses of the self / The occult seeker into the open came: / He heard the far and touched the intangible, / He gazed into the future and the unseen; / He used the powers earth-instruments cannot use, / A pastime made of the impossible; / He caught up fragments of the Omniscient’s thought, / He scattered formulas of omnipotence.

07.02_117:085 - Thus man in his little house made of earth’s dust / Grew towards an unseen heaven of thought and dream / Looking into the vast vistas of his mind / On a small globe dotting infinity.

07.02_117:086 - At last climbing a long and narrow stair / He stood alone on a high roof of things / And saw the light of a spiritual sun.

07.02_117:087 - Aspiring he transcends his earthly self; / He stands in the largeness of his soul new-born / Redeemed from encirclement by mortal things / And moves in a pure free spiritual realm / As in the rare breath of a stratosphere.

07.02_117:088 - A lost end of far lines of divinity, / He mounts by a frail thread to his high source; / He reaches his fount of immortality, / He calls the Godhead into his mortal life.

07.02_117:089 - All this the spirit concealed had done in her: / A portion of the mighty Mother came / Into her as into its own human part: / Amid the cosmic workings of the Gods / It marked her the centre of a wide-drawn scheme, / Dreamed in the passion of her far-seeing spirit / To mould humanity into God’s own shape / And lead this great blind struggling world to light / Or a new world discover or create.

07.02_117:090 - Earth must transform herself and equal Heaven / Or Heaven descend into earth’s mortal state.

07.02_117:091 - But for such vast spiritual change to be, / Out of the mystic cavern in man’s heart / The heavenly Psyche must put off her veil / And step into common nature’s crowded rooms / And stand uncovered in that nature’s front / And rule its thoughts and fill the body and life.

07.02_117:092 - Obedient to a high command she sat: / Time, life and death were passing incidents / Obstructing with their transient view her sight, / Her sight that must break through and liberate the god / Imprisoned in the visionless mortal man.

07.02_117:093 - The inferior nature born into ignorance / Still took too large a place, it veiled her self / And must be pushed aside to find her soul.


Canto 3 - 7.3: The Entry into the Inner Countries

Section I - 118: fixed the thought upon the saviour Name


07.03_118:001 - At first out of the busy hum of mind / As if from a loud thronged market into a cave / By an inward moment’s magic she had come, / A stark hushed emptiness became her self: / Her mind unvisited by the voice of thought / Stared at a void deep’s dumb infinity.

07.03_118:002 - Her heights receded, her depths behind her closed; / All fled away from her and left her blank.

07.03_118:003 - But when she came back to her self of thought, / Once more she was a human thing on earth, / A lump of Matter, a house of closed sight, / A mind compelled to think out ignorance, / A life-force pressed into a camp of works / And the material world her limiting field.

07.03_118:004 - Amazed like one unknowing she sought her way / Out of the tangle of man’s ignorant past / That took the surface person for the soul.

07.03_118:005 - Then a Voice spoke that dwelt on secret heights: / “For man thou seekst, not for thyself alone.

07.03_118:006 - Only if God assumes the human mind / And puts on mortal ignorance for his cloak / And makes himself the Dwarf with triple stride, / Can he help man to grow into the God.

07.03_118:007 - As man disguised the cosmic Greatness works / And finds the mystic inaccessible gate / And opens the Immortal’s golden door.

07.03_118:008 - Man human follows in God’s human steps.

07.03_118:009 - Accepting his darkness thou must bring to him light, / Accepting his sorrow thou must bring to him bliss.

07.03_118:010 - In Matter’s body find thy heaven-born soul.”

07.03_118:011 - Then Savitri surged out of her body’s wall / And stood a little span outside herself / And looked into her subtle being’s depths / And in its heart as in a lotus-bud / Divined her secret and mysterious soul.

07.03_118:012 - At the dim portal of the inner life / That bars out from our depths the body’s mind / And all that lives but by the body’s breath, / She knocked and pressed against the ebony gate.

07.03_118:013 - The living portal groaned with sullen hinge: / Heavily reluctant it complained inert / Against the tyranny of the spirit’s touch.

07.03_118:014 - A formidable voice cried from within: / “Back, creature of earth, lest tortured and torn thou die.”

07.03_118:015 - A dreadful murmur rose like a dim sea; / The Serpent of the threshold hissing rose, / A fatal guardian hood with monstrous coils, / The hounds of darkness growled with jaws agape, / And trolls and gnomes and goblins scowled and stared / And wild beast roarings thrilled the blood with fear / And menace muttered in a dangerous tongue.

07.03_118:016 - Unshaken her will pressed on the rigid bars: / The gate swung wide with a protesting jar, / The opponent Powers withdrew their dreadful guard; / Her being entered into the inner worlds.

07.03_118:017 - In a narrow passage, the subconscient’s gate, / She breathed with difficulty and pain and strove / To find the inner self concealed in sense.

07.03_118:018 - Into a dense of subtle Matter packed, / A cavity filled with a blind mass of power, / An opposition of misleading gleams, / A heavy barrier of unseeing sight, / She forced her way through body to the soul.

07.03_118:019 - Across a perilous border line she passed / Where life dips into the subconscient dusk / Or struggles from Matter into chaos of mind, / Aswarm with elemental entities / And fluttering shapes of vague half-bodied thought / And crude beginnings of incontinent force.

07.03_118:020 - At first a difficult narrowness was there, / A press of uncertain powers and drifting wills; / For all was there but nothing in its place.

07.03_118:021 - At times an opening came, a door was forced; / She crossed through spaces of a secret self / And trod in passages of inner Time.

07.03_118:022 - At last she broke into a form of things, / A start of finiteness, a world of sense: / But all was still confused, nothing self-found.

07.03_118:023 - Soul was not there but only cries of life.

07.03_118:024 - A thronged and clamorous air environed her.

07.03_118:025 - A horde of sounds defied significance, / A dissonant clash of cries and contrary calls; / A mob of visions broke across the sight, / A jostled sequence lacking sense and suite, / Feelings pushed through a packed and burdened heart, / Each forced its separate inconsequent way / But cared for nothing but its ego’s drive.

07.03_118:026 - A rally without key of common will, / Thought stared at thought and pulled at the taut brain / As if to pluck the reason from its seat / And cast its corpse into life’s wayside drain; / So might forgotten lie in Nature’s mud / Abandoned the slain sentinel of the soul.

07.03_118:027 - So could life’s power shake from it mind’s rule, / Nature renounce the spirit’s government / And the bare elemental energies / Make of the sense a glory of boundless joy, / A splendour of ecstatic anarchy, / A revel mighty and mad of utter bliss.

07.03_118:028 - This was the sense’s instinct void of soul / Or when the soul sleeps hidden void of power, / But now the vital godhead wakes within / And lifts the life with the supernal’s touch.

07.03_118:029 - But how shall come the glory and the flame / If mind is cast away into the abyss?

07.03_118:030 - For body without mind has not the light, / The rapture of spirit sense, the joy of life; / All then becomes subconscient, tenebrous, / Inconscience puts its seal on Nature’s page / Or else a mad disorder whirls the brain / Posting along a ravaged nature’s roads, / A chaos of disordered impulses / In which no light can come, no joy, no peace.

07.03_118:031 - This state now threatened, this she pushed from her.

07.03_118:032 - As if in a long endless tossing street / One driven mid a trampling hurrying crowd / Hour after hour she trod without release, / Holding by her will the senseless meute at bay; / Out of the dreadful press she dragged her will / And fixed her thought upon the saviour Name; / Then all grew still and empty; she was free.

07.03_118:033 - A large deliverance came, a vast calm space.

07.03_118:034 - Awhile she moved through a blank tranquillity / Of naked Light from an invisible sun, / A void that was a bodiless happiness, / A blissful vacuum of nameless peace.

07.03_118:035 - But now a mightier danger’s front drew near: / The press of bodily mind, the Inconscient’s brood / Of aimless thought and will had fallen from her.

07.03_118:036 - Approaching loomed a giant head of Life / Ungoverned by mind or soul, subconscient, vast.

07.03_118:037 - It tossed all power into a single drive, / It made its power a might of dangerous seas.

07.03_118:038 - Into the stillness of her silent self, / Into the whiteness of its muse of Space / A spate, a torrent of the speed of Life / Broke like a wind-lashed driven mob of waves / Racing on a pale floor of summer sand; / It drowned its banks, a mountain of climbing waves.

07.03_118:039 - Enormous was its vast and passionate voice.

07.03_118:040 - It cried to her listening spirit as it ran, / Demanding God’s submission to chainless Force.

07.03_118:041 - A deaf force calling to a status dumb, / A thousand voices in a muted Vast, / It claimed the heart’s support for its clutch at joy, / For its need to act the witness soul’s consent, / For its lust of power her neutral being’s seal.

07.03_118:042 - Into the wideness of her watching self / It brought a grandiose gust of the Breath of Life; / Its torrent carried the world’s hopes and fears, / All life’s, all Nature’s dissatisfied hungry cry, / And the longing all eternity cannot fill: / It called to the mountain secrecies of the soul / And the miracle of the never-dying fire, / It spoke to some first inexpressible ecstasy / Hidden in the creative beat of Life; / Out of the nether unseen deeps it tore / Its lure and magic of disordered bliss, / Into earth-light poured its maze of tangled charm / And heady draught of Nature’s primitive joy / And the fire and mystery of forbidden delight / Drunk from the world-libido’s bottomless well, / And the honey-sweet poison-wine of lust and death, / But dreamed a vintage of glory of life’s gods, / And felt as celestial rapture’s golden sting.

07.03_118:043 - The cycles of the infinity of desire / And the mystique that made an unrealised world / Wider than the known and closer than the unknown / In which hunt for ever the hounds of mind and life, / Tempted a deep dissatisfied urge within / To long for the unfulfilled and ever far / And make this life upon a limiting earth / A climb towards summits vanishing in the void, / A search for the glory of the impossible.

07.03_118:044 - It dreamed of that which never has been known, / It grasped at that which never has been won, / It chased into an Elysian memory / The charms that flee from the heart’s soon lost delight; / It dared the force that slays, the joys that hurt, / The imaged shape of unaccomplished things / And the summons to a Circean transmuting dance / And passion’s tenancy of the courts of love / And the wild Beast’s ramp and romp with Beauty and Life.

07.03_118:045 - It brought its cry and surge of opposite powers, / Its moments of the touch of luminous planes, / Its flame-ascensions and sky-pitched vast attempts, / Its fiery towers of dream built on the winds, / Its sinkings towards the darkness and the abyss, / Its honey of tenderness, its sharp wine of hate, / Its changes of sun and cloud, of laughter and tears, / Its bottomless danger pits and swallowing gulfs, / Its fear and joy and ecstasy and despair, / Its occult wizardries, its simple lines / And great communions and uplifting moves, / Its faith in heaven, its intercourse with hell.

07.03_118:046 - These powers were not blunt with the dead weight of earth, / They gave ambrosia’s taste and poison’s sting.

07.03_118:047 - There was an ardour in the gaze of Life / That saw heaven blue in the grey air of Night: / The impulses godward soared on passion’s wings.

07.03_118:048 - Mind’s quick-paced thoughts floated from their high necks / A glowing splendour as of an irised mane, / A parure of pure intuition’s light; / Its flame-foot gallop they could imitate: / Mind’s voices mimicked inspiration’s stress, / Its ictus of infallibility, / Its speed and lightning heaven-leap of the Gods.

07.03_118:049 - A trenchant blade that shore the nets of doubt, / Its sword of discernment seemed almost divine.

07.03_118:050 - Yet all that knowledge was a borrowed sun’s; / The forms that came were not heaven’s native births: / Its puissance dangerous and absolute / Could mingle poison with the wine of God.

07.03_118:051 - On these high shining backs falsehood could ride; / Truth lay with delight in error’s passionate arms / Gliding downstream in a blithe gilded barge: / She edged her ray with a magnificent lie.

07.03_118:052 - Here in Life’s nether realms all contraries meet; / Truth stares and does her works with bandaged eyes, / And Ignorance is Wisdom’s patron here.

07.03_118:053 - Those galloping hooves in their enthusiast speed / Could bear to a dangerous intermediate zone / Where Death walks wearing a robe of deathless Life.

07.03_118:054 - Or they enter the valley of the wandering Gleam / Whence, captives or victims of the specious Ray, / Souls trapped in that region never can escape.

07.03_118:055 - Agents, not masters, they serve Life’s desires / Toiling for ever in the snare of Time.

07.03_118:056 - Their bodies born out of some Nihil’s womb / Ensnare the spirit in the moment’s dreams, / Then perish vomiting the immortal soul / Out of Matter’s belly into the sink of Nought.

07.03_118:057 - Yet some uncaught, unslain can warily pass / Carrying Truth’s image in their sheltered heart, / Pluck Knowledge out of error’s screening grip, / Break paths through the blind walls of little self, / Then travel on to reach a greater life.

07.03_118:058 - All this streamed past her and seemed to her vision’s sight / As if around a high and voiceless isle / A clamour of waters from far unknown hills, / Swallowed its narrow banks in crowding waves / And made a hungry world of white wild foam: / Hastening, a dragon with a million feet, / Its foam and cry, a drunken giant’s din, / Tossing a mane of Darkness into God’s sky, / It ebbed receding into a distant roar; / Then smiled again a large and tranquil air: / Blue heaven, green earth, partners of Beauty’s reign, / Lived as of old, companions in happiness; / And in the world’s heart laughed the joy of life.

07.03_118:059 - All now was still, the soil shone dry and pure.

07.03_118:060 - Through it all she moved not, plunged not in the vain waves.

07.03_118:061 - Out of the vastness of the silent self / Life’s clamour fled; her spirit was mute and free.



Section I - 119: 


07.03_119:001 - Then journeying forward through the self’s wide hush / She came into a brilliant ordered Space.

07.03_119:002 - There Life dwelt parked in an armed tranquillity; / A chain was on her strong insurgent heart.

07.03_119:003 - Tamed to the modesty of a measured pace, / She kept no more her vehement stride and rush; / She had lost the careless majesty of her muse / And the ample grandeur of her regal force; / Curbed were her mighty pomps, her splendid waste, / Sobered the revels of her bacchant play, / Cut down were her squanderings in desire’s bazaar, / Coerced her despot will, her fancy’s dance, / A cold stolidity bound the riot of sense.

07.03_119:004 - Her spirit’s bounds they cast in rigid lines.

07.03_119:005 - A royalty without freedom was her lot; / The sovereign throned obeyed her ministers: / Her servants mind and sense governed her house / And guarded with a phalanx of armoured rules / The reason’s balanced reign, kept order and peace.

07.03_119:006 - Her will lived closed in adamant walls of law, / Coerced was her force by chains that feigned to adorn, / Imagination was prisoned in a fort, / Her wanton and licentious favourite; / Reality’s poise and reason’s symmetry / Were set in its place sentinelled by marshalled facts, / They gave to the soul for throne a bench of Law, / For kingdom a small world of rule and line: / The ages’ wisdom, shrivelled to scholiast lines, / Shrank patterned into a copy-book device.

07.03_119:007 - The Spirit’s almighty freedom was not here: / A schoolman mind had captured life’s large space, / But chose to live in bare and paltry rooms / Parked off from the too vast dangerous universe, / Fearing to lose its soul in the infinite.

07.03_119:008 - Even the Idea’s ample sweep was cut / Into a system, chained to fixed pillars of thought / Or rivetted to Matter’s solid ground: / Or else the soul was lost in its own heights: / Obeying the Ideal’s highbrowed law / Thought based a throne on unsubstantial air / Disdaining earth’s flat triviality: / It barred reality out to live in its dreams.

07.03_119:009 - Or all stepped into a systemed universe: / Life’s empire was a managed continent, / Its thoughts an army ranked and disciplined; / Uniformed they kept the logic of their fixed place / At the bidding of the trained centurion mind.

07.03_119:010 - Or each stepped into its station like a star / Or marched through fixed and constellated heavens / Or kept its feudal rank among its peers / In the sky’s unchanging cosmic hierarchy.

07.03_119:011 - Or like a highbred maiden with chaste eyes / Forbidden to walk unveiled the public ways, / She must in close secluded chambers move, / Her feeling in cloisters live or gardened paths.

07.03_119:012 - Life was consigned to a safe level path, / It dared not tempt the great and difficult heights / Or climb to be neighbour to a lonely star / Or skirt the danger of the precipice / Or tempt the foam-curled breakers’ perilous laugh, / Adventure’s lyrist, danger’s amateur, / Or into her chamber call some flaming god, / Or leave the world’s bounds and where no limits are, / Meet with the heart’s passion the Adorable / Or set the world ablaze with the inner Fire.

07.03_119:013 - A chastened epithet in the prose of life, / She must fill with colour just her sanctioned space, / Not break out of the cabin of the idea / Nor trespass into rhythms too high or vast.

07.03_119:014 - Even when it soared into ideal air, / Thought’s flight lost not itself in heaven’s blue: / It drew upon the skies a patterned flower / Of disciplined beauty and harmonic light.

07.03_119:015 - A temperate vigilant spirit governed life: / Its acts were tools of the considering thought, / Too cold to take fire and set the world ablaze, / Or the careful reason’s diplomatic moves / Testing the means to a prefigured end, / Or at the highest pitch some calm Will’s plan / Or a strategy of some High Command within / To conquer the secret treasures of the gods / Or win for a masked king some glorious world, / Not a reflex of the spontaneous self, / An index of the being and its moods, / A winging of conscious spirit, a sacrament / Of life’s communion with the still Supreme / Or its pure movement on the Eternal’s road.

07.03_119:016 - Or else for the body of some high Idea / A house was built with too close-fitting bricks; / Action and thought cemented made a wall / Of small ideals limiting the soul.

07.03_119:017 - Even meditation mused on a narrow seat; / And worship turned to an exclusive God, / To the Universal in a chapel prayed / Whose doors were shut against the universe: / Or kneeled to the bodiless Impersonal / A mind shut to the cry and fire of love: / A rational religion dried the heart.

07.03_119:018 - It planned a smooth life’s acts with ethics’ rule / Or offered a cold and flameless sacrifice.

07.03_119:019 - The sacred Book lay on its sanctified desk / Wrapped in interpretation’s silken strings: / A credo sealed up its spiritual sense.



Section I - 120: quiet country of fixed mind


07.03_120:001 - Here was a quiet country of fixed mind, / Here life no more was all nor passion’s voice; / A cry of sense had sunk into a hush.

07.03_120:002 - Soul was not there nor spirit, but mind alone; / Mind claimed to be the spirit and the soul.

07.03_120:003 - The spirit saw itself as form of mind, / Lost itself in the glory of the thought, / A light that made invisible the sun.

07.03_120:004 - Into a firm and settled space she came / Where all was still and all things kept their place.

07.03_120:005 - Each found what it had sought and knew its aim.

07.03_120:006 - All had a final last stability.

07.03_120:007 - There one stood forth who bore authority / On an important brow and held a rod; / Command was incarnate in his gesture and tone; / Tradition’s petrified wisdom carved his speech, / His sentences savoured the oracle.

07.03_120:008 - “Traveller or pilgrim of the inner world, / Fortunate art thou to reach our brilliant air / Flaming with thought’s supreme finality.

07.03_120:009 - O aspirant to the perfect way of life, / Here find it; rest from search and live at peace.

07.03_120:010 - Ours is the home of cosmic certainty.

07.03_120:011 - Here is the truth, God’s harmony is here.

07.03_120:012 - Register thy name in the book of the elite, / Admitted by the sanction of the few, / Adopt thy station of knowledge, thy post in mind, / Thy ticket of order draw in Life’s bureau / And praise thy fate that made thee one of ours.

07.03_120:013 - All here, docketed and tied, the mind can know, / All schemed by law that God permits to life.

07.03_120:014 - This is the end and there is no beyond.

07.03_120:015 - Here is the safety of the ultimate wall, / Here is the clarity of the sword of Light, / Here is the victory of a single Truth, / Here burns the diamond of flawless bliss.

07.03_120:016 - A favourite of Heaven and Nature live.”

07.03_120:017 - But to the too satisfied and confident sage / Savitri replied casting into his world / Sight’s deep release, the heart’s questioning inner voice.

07.03_120:018 - For here the heart spoke not, only clear daylight / Of intellect reigned here, limiting, cold, precise.

07.03_120:019 - “Happy are they who in this chaos of things, / This coming and going of the feet of Time, / Can find the single Truth, the eternal Law: / Untouched they live by hope and doubt and fear.

07.03_120:020 - Happy are men anchored on fixed belief / In this uncertain and ambiguous world, / Or who have planted in the heart’s rich soil / One small grain of spiritual certitude.

07.03_120:021 - Happiest who stand on faith as on a rock.

07.03_120:022 - But I must pass leaving the ended search, / Truth’s rounded outcome firm, immutable / And this harmonic building of world-fact, / This ordered knowledge of apparent things.

07.03_120:023 - Here I can stay not, for I seek my soul.”

07.03_120:024 - None answered in that bright contented world, / Or only turned on their accustomed way / Astonished to hear questioning in that air / Or thoughts that could still turn to the Beyond.

07.03_120:025 - But some murmured, passers-by from kindred spheres: / Each by his credo judged the thought she spoke.

07.03_120:026 - “Who then is this who knows not that the soul / Is a least gland or a secretion’s fault / Disquieting the sane government of the mind, / Disordering the function of the brain, / Or a yearning lodged in Nature’s mortal house / Or dream whispered in man’s cave of hollow thought / Who would prolong his brief unhappy term / Or cling to living in a sea of death?"

07.03_120:027 - But others, “Nay, it is her spirit she seeks.

07.03_120:028 - A splendid shadow of the name of God, / A formless lustre from the Ideal’s realm, / The Spirit is the Holy Ghost of Mind; / But none has touched its limits or seen its face.

07.03_120:029 - Each soul is the great Father’s crucified Son, / Mind is that soul’s one parent, its conscious cause, / The ground on which trembles a brief passing light, / Mind, sole creator of the apparent world.

07.03_120:030 - All that is here is part of our own self; / Our minds have made the world in which we live.”

07.03_120:031 - Another with mystic and unsatisfied eyes / Who loved his slain belief and mourned its death: / “Is there one left who seeks for a Beyond?

07.03_120:032 - Can still the path be found, opened the gate?"



Section I - 121: company of luminous gods


07.03_121:001 - So she fared on across her silent self.

07.03_121:002 - To a road she came thronged with an ardent crowd / Who sped brilliant fire-footed, sun-light eyed, / Pressing to reach the world’s mysterious wall, / And pass through masked doorways into outer mind / Where the Light comes not nor the mystic voice, / Messengers from our subliminal greatnesses, / Guests from the cavern of the secret soul.

07.03_121:003 - Into dim spiritual somnolence they break / Or shed wide wonder on our waking self, / Ideas that haunt us with their radiant tread, / Dreams that are hints of unborn Reality, / Strange goddesses with deep-pooled magical eyes, / Strong wind-haired gods carrying harps of hope, / Great moon-hued visions gliding through gold air, / Aspiration’s sun-dream head and star-carved limbs, / Emotions making common hearts sublime.

07.03_121:004 - And Savitri mingling in that glorious crowd, / Yearning to the spiritual light they bore, / Longed once to hasten like them to save God’s world; / But she reined back the high passion in her heart: / She knew that first she must discover her soul.

07.03_121:005 - Only who save themselves can others save.

07.03_121:006 - In contrary sense she faced life’s riddling truth; / They carrying the light to suffering men / Hurried with eager feet to the outer world; / Her eyes were turned towards the eternal source.

07.03_121:007 - Outstretching her hands to stay the throng she cried: / “O happy company of luminous gods, / Reveal, who know, the road that I must tread,— / For surely that bright quarter is your home,— / To find the birthplace of the occult Fire / And the deep mansion of my secret soul.”

07.03_121:008 - One answered pointing to a silence dim / On a remote extremity of sleep / In some far background of the inner world.

07.03_121:009 - “O Savitri, from thy hidden soul we come.

07.03_121:010 - We are the messengers, the occult gods / Who help men’s drab and heavy ignorant lives / To wake to beauty and the wonder of things / Touching them with glory and divinity; / In evil we light the deathless flame of good / And hold the torch of knowledge on ignorant roads; / We are thy will and all men’s will towards Light.

07.03_121:011 - O human copy and disguise of God / Who seekst the deity thou keepest hid / And livest by the Truth thou hast not known, / Follow the world’s winding highway to its source.

07.03_121:012 - There in the silence few have ever reached, / Thou shalt see the Fire burning on the bare stone / And the deep cavern of thy secret soul.”

07.03_121:013 - Then Savitri following the great winding road / Came where it dwindled into a narrow path / Trod only by rare wounded pilgrim-feet.

07.03_121:014 - A few bright forms emerged from unknown depths / And looked at her with calm immortal eyes.

07.03_121:015 - There was no sound to break the brooding hush; / One felt the silent nearness of the soul.


Canto 4 - 7.4: The Triple Soul-Forces

Section I - 122: Mother of Grief Divine


07.04_122:001 - Here from a low and prone and listless ground / The passion of the first ascent began; / A moon-bright face in a sombre cloud of hair, / A Woman sat in a pale lustrous robe.

07.04_122:002 - A rugged and ragged soil was her bare seat, / Beneath her feet a sharp and wounding stone.

07.04_122:003 - A divine pity on the peaks of the world, / A spirit touched by the grief of all that lives, / She looked out far and saw from inner mind / This questionable world of outward things, / Of false appearances and plausible shapes, / This dubious cosmos stretched in the ignorant Void, / The pangs of earth, the toil and speed of the stars / And the difficult birth and dolorous end of life.

07.04_122:004 - Accepting the universe as her body of woe, / The Mother of the seven sorrows bore / The seven stabs that pierced her bleeding heart: / The beauty of sadness lingered on her face, / Her eyes were dim with the ancient stain of tears.

07.04_122:005 - Her heart was riven with the world’s agony / And burdened with the sorrow and struggle in Time, / An anguished music trailed in her rapt voice.

07.04_122:006 - Absorbed in a deep compassion’s ecstasy, / Lifting the mild ray of her patient gaze, / In soft sweet training words slowly she spoke: / “O Savitri, I am thy secret soul.

07.04_122:007 - To share the suffering of the world I came, / I draw my children’s pangs into my breast.

07.04_122:008 - I am the nurse of the dolour beneath the stars; / I am the soul of all who wailing writhe / Under the ruthless harrow of the Gods.

07.04_122:009 - I am woman, nurse and slave and beaten beast; / I tend the hands that gave me cruel blows; / The hearts that spurned my love and zeal I serve; / I am the courted queen, the pampered doll, / I am the giver of the bowl of rice, / I am the worshipped Angel of the House.

07.04_122:010 - I am in all that suffers and that cries.

07.04_122:011 - Mine is the prayer that climbs in vain from earth, / I am traversed by my creatures’ agonies, / I am the spirit in a world of pain.

07.04_122:012 - The scream of tortured flesh and tortured hearts / Fall’n back on heart and flesh unheard by Heaven / Has rent with helpless grief and wrath my soul.

07.04_122:013 - I have seen the peasant burning in his hut, / I have seen the slashed corpse of the slaughtered child, / Heard woman’s cry ravished and stripped and haled / Amid the bayings of the hell-hound mob, / I have looked on, I had no power to save.

07.04_122:014 - I have brought no arm of strength to aid or slay; / God gave me love, he gave me not his force.

07.04_122:015 - I have shared the toil of the yoked animal drudge / Pushed by the goad, encouraged by the whip; / I have shared the fear-filled life of bird and beast, / Its long hunt for the day’s precarious food, / Its covert slink and crouch and hungry prowl, / Its pain and terror seized by beak and claw.

07.04_122:016 - I have shared the daily life of common men, / Its petty pleasures and its petty cares, / Its press of troubles and haggard horde of ills, / Earth’s trail of sorrow hopeless of relief, / The unwanted tedious labour without joy, / And the burden of misery and the strokes of fate.

07.04_122:017 - I have been pity, leaning over pain / And the tender smile that heals the wounded heart / And sympathy making life less hard to bear.

07.04_122:018 - Man has felt near my unseen face and hands; / I have become the sufferer and his moan, / I have lain down with the mangled and the slain, / I have lived with the prisoner in his dungeon cell, / Heavy on my shoulders weighs the yoke of Time: / Nothing refusing of creation’s load, / I have borne all and know I still must bear: / Perhaps when the world sinks into a last sleep, / I too may sleep in dumb eternal peace.

07.04_122:019 - I have borne the calm indifference of Heaven, / Watched Nature’s cruelty to suffering things / While God passed silent by nor turned to help.

07.04_122:020 - Yet have I cried not out against his will, / Yet have I not accused his cosmic Law.

07.04_122:021 - Only to change this great hard world of pain / A patient prayer has risen from my breast; / A pallid resignation lights my brow, / Within me a blind faith and mercy dwell; / I carry the fire that never can be quenched / And the compassion that supports the suns.

07.04_122:022A - I am the hope that looks towards my God, / My God who never came to me till now; / His voice I hear that ever says ‘I come’: / I know that one day he shall come at last.”

07.04_122:023 - She ceased, and like an echo from below / Answering her pathos of divine complaint / A voice of wrath took up the dire refrain, / A growl of thunder or roar of angry beast, / The beast that crouching growls within man’s depths,— / Voice of a tortured Titan once a God.

07.04_122:024 - “I am the Man of Sorrows, I am he / Who is nailed on the wide cross of the universe; / To enjoy my agony God built the earth, / My passion he has made his drama’s theme.

07.04_122:025 - He has sent me naked into his bitter world / And beaten me with his rods of grief and pain / That I might cry and grovel at his feet / And offer him worship with my blood and tears.

07.04_122:026 - I am Prometheus under the vulture’s beak, / Man, the discoverer of the undying Fire, / In the flame he kindled burning like a moth; / I am the seeker who can never find, / I am the fighter who can never win, / I am the runner who never touched his goal; / Hell tortures me with the edges of my thought, / Heaven tortures me with the splendour of my dreams.

07.04_122:027 - What profit have I of my human soul?

07.04_122:028 - I toil like the animal, like the animal die.

07.04_122:029 - I am man the rebel, man the helpless serf; / Fate and my fellows cheat me of my wage.

07.04_122:030 - I loosen with my blood my servitude’s seal / And shake from my aching neck the oppressor’s knees / Only to seat new tyrants on my back: / My teachers lesson me in slavery, / I am shown God’s stamp and my own true signature / Upon the sorry contract of my fate.

07.04_122:031 - I have loved, but none has loved me since my birth; / My fruit of works is given to other hands: / All that is left me is my evil thoughts, / My sordid quarrel against God and man, / Envy of the riches that I cannot share, / Hate of a happiness that is not mine.

07.04_122:032 - I know my fate will ever be the same, / It is my Nature’s work that cannot change: / I have loved for mine, not for the beloved’s sake, / I have loved for myself and not for others’ lives.

07.04_122:033 - Each in himself is sole by Nature’s law, / So God has made his harsh and dreadful world, / So has he built the petty heart of man; / Only by force and ruse can man survive: / For pity is a weakness in his breast, / His goodness is a laxity in the nerves, / His kindness an investment for return, / His altruism is ego’s other face: / He serves the world that him the world may serve.

07.04_122:034 - If once the Titan’s strength could wake in me, / If Enceladus from Etna could arise, / I then would reign the master of the world / And like a God enjoy man’s bliss and pain.

07.04_122:035 - But God has taken from me the ancient force.

07.04_122:036 - There is a dull consent in my sluggish heart, / A fierce satisfaction with my special pangs / As if they made me taller than my kind; / Only by suffering can I excel.

07.04_122:037 - I am the victim of titanic ills, / I am the doer of demoniac deeds; / I was made for evil, evil is my lot; / Evil I must be and by evil live; / Nought other can I do but be myself; / What Nature made me, that I must remain.

07.04_122:038 - I suffer and toil and weep; I moan and hate.”

07.04_122:039 - And Savitri heard the Voice, the echo heard / And turning to her being of pity spoke: / “Madonna of suffering, Mother of grief divine, / Thou art a portion of my soul put forth / To bear the unbearable sorrow of the world.

07.04_122:040 - Because thou art, men yield not to their doom, / But ask for happiness and strive with fate; / Because thou art, the wretched still can hope.

07.04_122:041 - But thine is the power to solace, not to save.

07.04_122:042 - One day I will return, a bringer of strength, / And make thee drink from the Eternal’s cup; / His streams of force shall triumph in thy limbs / And Wisdom’s calm control thy passionate heart.

07.04_122:043 - Thy love shall be the bond of human kind, / Compassion the bright king of Nature’s acts: / Misery shall pass abolished from the earth; / The world shall be freed from the anger of the Beast, / From the cruelty of the Titan and his pain.

07.04_122:044 - There shall be peace and joy for ever more.”


Section I - 123: Mother of Might and Force


07.04_123:001 - On passed she in her spirit’s upward route.

07.04_123:002 - An ardent grandeur climbed mid ferns and rocks, / A quiet wind flattered the heart to warmth, / A finer perfume breathed from slender trees.

07.04_123:003 - All beautiful grew, subtle and high and strange.

07.04_123:004 - Here on a boulder carved like a huge throne / A Woman sat in gold and purple sheen, / Armed with the trident and the thunderbolt, / Her feet upon a couchant lion’s back.

07.04_123:005 - A formidable smile curved round her lips, / Heaven-fire laughed in the corners of her eyes; / Her body a mass of courage and heavenly strength, / She menaced the triumph of the nether gods.

07.04_123:006 - A halo of lightnings flamed around her head / And sovereignty a great cestus zoned her robe / And majesty and victory sat with her / Guarding in the wide cosmic battle-field / Against the flat equality of Death / And the all-levelling insurgent Night / The hierarchy of the ordered Powers, / The high changeless values, the peaked eminences, / The privileged aristocracy of Truth, / And in the governing Ideal’s sun / The triumvirate of wisdom, love and bliss / And the sole autocracy of the absolute Light.

07.04_123:007 - August on her seat in the inner world of Mind, / The Mother of Might looked down on passing things, / Listened to the advancing tread of Time, / Saw the irresistible wheeling of the suns / And heard the thunder of the march of God.

07.04_123:008 - Amid the swaying forces in their strife / Sovereign was her word of luminous command, / Her speech like a war-cry rang or a pilgrim chant.

07.04_123:009 - A charm restoring hope in failing hearts, / Aspired the harmony of her puissant voice: / “O Savitri, I am thy secret soul.

07.04_123:010 - I have come down into the human world / And the movement watched by an unsleeping Eye / And the dark contrariety of earth’s fate / And the battle of the bright and sombre Powers.

07.04_123:011 - I stand upon earth’s paths of danger and grief / And help the unfortunate and save the doomed.

07.04_123:012 - To the strong I bring the guerdon of their strength, / To the weak I bring the armour of my force; / To men who long I carry their coveted joy: / I am fortune justifying the great and wise / By the sanction of the plaudits of the crowd, / Then trampling them with the armed heel of Fate.

07.04_123:013 - My ear is leaned to the cry of the oppressed, / I topple down the thrones of tyrant kings: / A cry comes from proscribed and hunted lives / Appealing to me against a pitiless world, / A voice of the forsaken and desolate / And the lone prisoner in his dungeon cell.

07.04_123:014 - Men hail in my coming the Almighty’s force / Or praise with thankful tears his saviour Grace.

07.04_123:015 - I smite the Titan who bestrides the world / And slay the ogre in his blood-stained den.

07.04_123:016 - I am Durga, goddess of the proud and strong, / And Laksmi, queen of the fair and fortunate; / I wear the face of Kali when I kill, / I trample the corpses of the demon hordes.

07.04_123:017 - I am charged by God to do his mighty work, / Uncaring I serve his will who sent me forth, / Reckless of peril and earthly consequence.

07.04_123:018 - I reason not of virtue and of sin / But do the deed he has put into my heart.

07.04_123:019 - I fear not for the angry frown of Heaven, / I flinch not from the red assault of Hell; / I crush the opposition of the gods, / Tread down a million goblin obstacles.

07.04_123:020 - I guide man to the path of the Divine / And guard him from the red Wolf and the Snake.

07.04_123:021 - I set in his mortal hand my heavenly sword / And put on him the breastplate of the gods.

07.04_123:022 - I break the ignorant pride of human mind / And lead the thought to the wideness of the Truth; / I rend man’s narrow and successful life / And force his sorrowful eyes to gaze at the sun / That he may die to earth and live in his soul.

07.04_123:023 - I know the goal, I know the secret route: / I have studied the map of the invisible worlds; / I am the battle’s head, the journey’s star.

07.04_123:024 - But the great obstinate world resists my word, / And the crookedness and evil in man’s heart / Is stronger than Reason, profounder than the Pit, / And the malignancy of hostile Powers / Puts craftily back the clock of destiny / And mightier seems than the eternal Will.

07.04_123:025 - The cosmic evil is too deep to unroot: / The cosmic suffering is too vast to heal.

07.04_123:026 - A few I guide who pass me towards the Light; / A few I save, the mass falls back unsaved; / A few I help, the many strive and fail: / But my heart I have hardened and I do my work: / Slowly the Light grows greater in the East, / Slowly the world progresses on God’s road.

07.04_123:027 - His seal is on my task, it cannot fail: / I shall hear the silver swing of heaven’s gates / When God comes out to meet the soul of the world.”

07.04_123:028 - She spoke and from the lower human world / An answer, a warped echo met her speech; / The voice came through the spaces of the mind / Of the dwarf-Titan, the deformed chained god / Who strives to master his nature’s rebel stuff / And make the universe his instrument.

07.04_123:029 - The Ego of this great world of desire / Claimed earth and the wide heavens for the use / Of man, head of the life it shapes on earth, / Its representative and conscious soul, / And symbol of evolving light and force / And vessel of the godhead that must be.

07.04_123:030 - A thinking animal, Nature’s struggling lord / Has made of her his nurse and tool and slave / And pays to her as wage and emolument / Inescapably by a deep law in things / His heart’s grief and his body’s death and pain; / His pains are her means to grow, to see and feel; / His death assists her immortality.

07.04_123:031 - A tool and slave of his own slave and tool, / He praises his free will and his master mind / And is pushed by her upon her chosen paths; / Possessor he is possessed and, ruler, ruled, / Her conscious automaton, her desire’s dupe.

07.04_123:032 - His soul is her guest, a sovereign mute, inert, / His body her robot, his life her way to live, / His conscious mind her strong revolted serf.

07.04_123:033 - The voice rose up and smote some inner sun: / “I am the heir of the forces of the earth, / Slowly I make good my right to my estate; / A growing godhead in her divinised mud, / I climb, a claimant to the throne of heaven.

07.04_123:034 - The last born of the earth I stand the first; / Her slow millenniums waited for my birth.

07.04_123:035 - Although I live in Time besieged by Death, / Precarious owner of my body and soul / Housed on a little speck amid the stars, / For me and my use the universe was made.

07.04_123:036 - Immortal spirit in the perishing clay, / I am God still unevolved in human form; / Even if he is not, he becomes in me.

07.04_123:037 - The sun and moon are lights upon my path; / Air was invented for my lungs to breathe, / Conditioned as a wide and wallless space / For my winged chariot’s wheels to cleave a road, / The sea was made for me to swim and sail / And bear my golden commerce on its back: / It laughs cloven by my pleasure’s gliding keel, / I laugh at its black stare of fate and death.

07.04_123:038 - The earth is my floor, the sky my living’s roof.

07.04_123:039 - All was prepared through many a silent age.

07.04_123:040 - God made experiments with animal shapes, / Then only when all was ready I was born.

07.04_123:041 - I was born weak and small and ignorant, / A helpless creature in a difficult world, / Travelling through my brief years with death at my side: / I have grown greater than Nature, wiser than God.

07.04_123:042 - I have made real what she never dreamed, / I have seized her powers and harnessed for my work, / I have shaped her metals and new metals made; / I will make glass and raiment out of milk, / Make iron velvet, water unbreakable stone, / Like God in his astuce of artist skill, / Mould from one primal plasm protean forms, / In single nature multitudinous lives, / All that imagination can conceive / In mind intangible, remould anew / In Matter’s plastic solid and concrete; / No magic can surpass my magic’s skill.

07.04_123:043 - There is no miracle I shall not achieve.

07.04_123:044 - What God imperfect left, I will complete, / Out of a tangled mind and half-made soul / His sin and error I will eliminate; / What he invented not, I shall invent: / He was the first creator, I am the last.

07.04_123:045 - I have found the atoms from which he built the worlds: / The first tremendous cosmic energy / Missioned shall leap to slay my enemy kin, / Expunge a nation or abolish a race, / Death’s silence leave where there was laughter and joy.

07.04_123:046 - Or the fissured invisible shall spend God’s force / To extend my comforts and expand my wealth, / To speed my car which now the lightnings drive / And turn the engines of my miracles.

07.04_123:047 - I will take his means of sorcery from his hands / And do with them greater wonders than his best.

07.04_123:048 - Yet through it all I have kept my balanced thought; / I have studied my being, I have examined the world, / I have grown a master of the arts of life.

07.04_123:049 - I have tamed the wild beast trained to be my friend; / He guards my house, looks up waiting my will.

07.04_123:050 - I have taught my kind to serve and to obey.

07.04_123:051 - I have used the mystery of the cosmic waves / To see far distance and to hear far words: / I have conquered Space and knitted close all earth: / Soon I shall know the secrets of the Mind: / I play with knowledge and with ignorance / And sin and virtue my inventions are, / I can transcend or sovereignly use.

07.04_123:052 - I shall know mystic truths, seize occult powers.

07.04_123:053 - I shall slay my enemies with a look or thought, / I shall sense the unspoken feelings of all hearts / And see and hear the hidden thoughts of men.

07.04_123:054 - When earth is mastered, I shall conquer heaven; / The gods shall be my aids or menial folk, / No wish I harbour unfulfilled shall die: / Omnipotence and omniscience shall be mine.”

07.04_123:055 - And Savitri heard the voice, the warped echo heard / And turning to her being of power she spoke: / “Madonna of might, Mother of works and force, / Thou art a portion of my soul put forth / To help mankind and help the travail of Time.

07.04_123:056 - Because thou art in him, man hopes and dares; / Because thou art, men’s souls can climb the heavens / And walk like Gods in the presence of the Supreme.

07.04_123:057 - But without wisdom power is like a wind, / It can breathe upon the heights and kiss the sky, / It cannot build the extreme eternal things.

07.04_123:058 - Thou hast given men strength, wisdom thou couldst not give.

07.04_123:059 - One day I will return, a bringer of light, / Then I will give to thee the mirror of God; / Thou shalt see self and world as by him they are seen / Reflected in the bright pool of thy soul.

07.04_123:060 - Thy wisdom shall be vast as vast thy power.

07.04_123:061 - Then hate shall dwell no more in human hearts, / And fear and weakness shall desert men’s lives, / The cry of the ego shall be hushed within, / Its lion roar that claims the world as food, / All shall be might and bliss and happy force.”



Section I - 124: Madonna of Light


07.04_124:001 - Ascending still her spirit’s upward route / She came into a high and happy space, / A wide tower of vision whence all could be seen / And all was centred in a single view / As when by distance separate scenes grow one / And a harmony is made of hues at war.

07.04_124:002 - The wind was still and fragrance packed the air.

07.04_124:003 - There was a carol of birds and murmur of bees, / And all that is common and natural and sweet, / Yet intimately divine to heart and soul.

07.04_124:004 - A nearness thrilled of the spirit to its source / And deepest things seemed obvious, close and true.

07.04_124:005B - Here, living centre of that vision of peace, / A Woman sat in clear and crystal light: / Heaven had unveiled its lustre in her eyes, / Her feet were moonbeams, her face was a bright sun, / Her smile could persuade a dead lacerated heart / To live again and feel the hands of calm.

07.04_124:006 - A low music heard became her floating voice: / “O Savitri, I am thy secret soul.

07.04_124:007 - I have come down to the wounded desolate earth / To heal her pangs and lull her heart to rest / And lay her head upon the Mother’s lap / That she may dream of God and know his peace / And draw the harmony of higher spheres / Into the rhythm of earth’s rude troubled days.

07.04_124:008 - I show to her the figures of bright Gods / And bring strength and solace to her struggling life; / High things that now are only words and forms / I reveal to her in the body of their power.

07.04_124:009 - I am peace that steals into man’s war-worn breast, / Amid the reign of Hell his acts create / A hostel where Heaven’s messengers can lodge; / I am charity with the kindly hands that bless; / I am silence mid the noisy tramp of life; / I am Knowledge poring on her cosmic map.

07.04_124:010 - In the anomalies of the human heart / Where Good and Evil are close bed-fellows / And Light is by Darkness dogged at every step, / Where his largest knowledge is an ignorance, / I am the Power that labours towards the best / And works for God and looks up towards the heights.

07.04_124:011 - I make even sin and error stepping stones / And all experience a long march towards Light.

07.04_124:012 - Out of the Inconscient I build consciousness / And lead through death to reach immortal life.

07.04_124:013 - Many are God’s forms by which he grows in man; / They stamp his thoughts and deeds with divinity, / Uplift the stature of the human clay / Or slowly transmute it into heaven’s gold.

07.04_124:014 - He is the Good for which men fight and die, / He is the War of Right with Titan Wrong, / He is Freedom rising deathless from her pyre, / He is Valour guarding still the desperate pass / Or lone and erect on the shattered barricade / Or a sentinel in the dangerous echoing Night.

07.04_124:015 - He is the crown of the martyr burned in flame / And the glad resignation of the saint / And courage indifferent to the wounds of Time / And the hero’s might wrestling with death and Fate.

07.04_124:016 - He is Wisdom incarnate on a glorious throne / And the calm autocracy of the sage’s rule.

07.04_124:017 - He is the high and solitary Thought / Aloof above the ignorant multitude: / He is the prophet’s voice, the sight of the seer.

07.04_124:018 - He is Beauty nectar of the passionate soul, / He is the Truth by which the spirit lives.

07.04_124:019 - He is the riches of the spiritual Vast / Poured out in healing streams on indigent Life; / He is Eternity lured from hour to hour, / He is Infinity in a little space: / He is Immortality in the arms of Death.

07.04_124:020 - These powers I am and at my call they come.

07.04_124:021 - Thus slowly I lift man’s soul nearer the Light.

07.04_124:022 - But human mind clings to its ignorance, / And to its littleness the human heart, / And to its right to grief the earthly life.

07.04_124:023 - Only when Eternity takes Time by the hand, / Only when infinity weds the finite’s thought, / Can man be free from himself and live with God.

07.04_124:024 - I bring meanwhile the gods upon the earth; / I bring back hope to the despairing heart; / I give peace to the humble and the great / And shed my grace on the foolish and the wise.

07.04_124:025 - I shall save earth, if earth consents to be saved.

07.04_124:026 - Then Love shall at last unwounded tread earth’s soil; / Man’s mind shall admit the sovereignty of Truth / And body bear the immense descent of God.”

07.04_124:027 - She spoke and from the ignorant nether plane / A cry, a warped echo naked and shuddering came.

07.04_124:028 - A voice of the sense-shackled human mind / Carried its proud complaint of Godlike power / Hedged by the limits of a mortal’s thoughts, / Bound in the chains of earthly ignorance.

07.04_124:029 - Imprisoned in his body and his brain / The mortal cannot see God’s mighty whole / Or share in his vast and deep identity / Who stands unguessed within our ignorant hearts / And knows all things because he is one with all.

07.04_124:030 - Man only sees the cosmic surfaces.

07.04_124:031 - Then wondering what may lie hid from the sense / A little way he delves to depths below: / But soon he stops, he cannot reach life’s core / Or commune with the throbbing heart of things.

07.04_124:032 - He sees the naked body of the Truth / Though often baffled by her endless garbs, / But cannot look upon her soul within.

07.04_124:033 - Then, furious for a knowledge absolute, / He tears all details out and stabs and digs: / Only the shape’s contents he holds for use; / The spirit escapes or dies beneath his knife.

07.04_124:034 - He sees as a blank stretch, a giant waste / The crowding riches of infinity.

07.04_124:035 - The finite he has made his central field, / Its plan dissects, masters its processes, / That which moves all is hidden from his gaze, / His poring eyes miss the unseen behind.

07.04_124:036 - He has the blind man’s subtle unerring touch / Or the slow traveller’s sight of distant scenes; / The soul’s revealing contacts are not his.

07.04_124:037 - Yet is he visited by intuitive light / And inspiration comes from the Unknown; / But only reason and sense he feels as sure, / They only are his trusted witnesses.

07.04_124:038 - Thus is he baulked, his splendid effort vain; / His knowledge scans bright pebbles on the shore / Of the huge ocean of his ignorance.

07.04_124:039 - Yet grandiose were the accents of that cry, / A cosmic pathos trembled in its tone.

07.04_124:040 - “I am the mind of God’s great ignorant world / Ascending to knowledge by the steps he made; / I am the all-discovering Thought of man.

07.04_124:041 - I am a god fettered by Matter and sense, / An animal prisoned in a fence of thorns, / A beast of labour asking for his food, / A smith tied to his anvil and his forge.

07.04_124:042 - Yet have I loosened the cord, enlarged my room.

07.04_124:043 - I have mapped the heavens and analysed the stars, / Described the orbits through the grooves of Space, / Measured the miles that separate the suns, / Computed their longevity in Time.

07.04_124:044 - I have delved into earth’s bowels and torn out / The riches guarded by her dull brown soil.

07.04_124:045 - I have classed the changes of her stony crust / And of her biography discovered the dates, / Rescued the pages of all Nature’s plan.

07.04_124:046 - The tree of evolution I have sketched, / Each branch and twig and leaf in its own place, / In the embryo tracked the history of forms, / And the genealogy framed of all that lives.

07.04_124:047 - I have detected plasm and cell and gene, / The protozoa traced, man’s ancestors, / The humble originals from whom he rose; / I know how he was born and how he dies; / Only what end he serves I know not yet, / Or if there is aim at all or any end / Or push of rich creative purposeful joy / In the wide works of the terrestrial power.

07.04_124:048 - I have caught her intricate processes, none is left: / Her huge machinery is in my hands; / I have seized the cosmic energies for my use.

07.04_124:049 - I have pored on her infinitesimal elements / And her invisible atoms have unmasked: / All Matter is a book I have perused; / Only some pages now are left to read.

07.04_124:050 - I have seen the ways of life, the paths of mind; / I have studied the methods of the ant and ape / And the behaviour learnt of man and worm.

07.04_124:051 - If God is at work his secrets I have found.

07.04_124:052 - But still the Cause of things is left in doubt, / Their truth flees from pursuit into a void; / When all has been explained nothing is known.

07.04_124:053 - What chose the process, whence the Power sprung / I know not and perhaps shall never know.

07.04_124:054 - A mystery is this mighty Nature’s birth; / A mystery is the elusive stream of mind, / A mystery the protean freak of life.

07.04_124:055 - What I have learnt, Chance leaps to contradict; / What I have built is seized and torn by Fate.

07.04_124:056 - I can foresee the acts of Matter’s force, / But not the march of the destiny of man: / He is driven upon paths he did not choose, / He falls trampled underneath the rolling wheels.

07.04_124:057 - My great philosophies are a reasoned guess; / The mystic heavens that claim the human soul / Are a charlatanism of the imagining brain: / All is a speculation or a dream: / In the end the world itself becomes a doubt: / The infinitesimal’s jest mocks mass and shape, / A laugh peals from the infinite’s finite mask.

07.04_124:058 - Perhaps the world is an error of our sight, / A trick repeated in each flash of sense, / An unreal mind hallucinates the soul / With a stress-vision of false reality, / Or a dance of Maya veils the Void unborn.

07.04_124:059 - Even if a greater consciousness I could reach, / What profit is it then for Thought to win / A Real which is for ever ineffable / Or hunt to its lair the bodiless Self or make / The Unknowable the target of the soul?

07.04_124:060 - Nay, let me work within my mortal bounds, / Not live beyond life nor think beyond the mind; / Our smallness saves us from the Infinite.

07.04_124:061 - In a frozen grandeur lone and desolate / Call me not to die the great eternal Death, / Left naked of my own humanity / In the chill vast of the spirit’s boundlessness.

07.04_124:062 - Each creature by its nature’s limits lives, / And how can one evade his native fate?

07.04_124:063 - Human I am, human let me remain / Till in the Inconscient I fall dumb and sleep.

07.04_124:064 - A high insanity, a chimera is this, / To think that God lives hidden in the clay / And that eternal Truth can dwell in Time, / And call to her to save our self and world.

07.04_124:065 - How can man grow immortal and divine / Transmuting the very stuff of which he is made?

07.04_124:066 - This wizard Gods may dream, not thinking men.”

07.04_124:067 - And Savitri heard the voice, the warped answer heard / And turning to her being of light she spoke: / “Madonna of light, Mother of joy and peace, / Thou art a portion of my self put forth / To raise the spirit to its forgotten heights / And wake the soul by touches of the heavens.

07.04_124:068 - Because thou art, the soul draws near to God; / Because thou art, love grows in spite of hate / And knowledge walks unslain in the pit of Night.

07.04_124:069 - But not by showering heaven’s golden rain / Upon the intellect’s hard and rocky soil / Can the tree of Paradise flower on earthly ground / And the Bird of Paradise sit upon life’s boughs / And the winds of Paradise visit mortal air.

07.04_124:070t - Even if thou rain down intuition’s rays, / The mind of man will think it earth’s own gleam, / His spirit by spiritual ego sink, / Or his soul dream shut in sainthood’s brilliant cell / Where only a bright shadow of God can come: / His hunger for the eternal thou must nurse / And fill his yearning heart with heaven’s fire / And bring God down into his body and life. #dangers-of-ego #misinterpretation #misuse-of-light #spiritual-instruction

07.04_124:071 - One day I shall return, His hands in mine / And thou shalt see the face of the Absolute.

07.04_124:072 - Then shall the holy marriage be achieved, / Then shall the divine family be born.

07.04_124:073 - There shall be light and peace in all the worlds.”


Canto 5 - 7.5: The Finding of the Soul

Section I - 125: House of Flame and Light


07.05_125:001 - Onward she passed seeking the soul’s mystic cave.

07.05_125:002 - At first she stepped into a night of God.

07.05_125:003 - The light was quenched that helps the labouring world, / The power that struggles and stumbles in our life; / This inefficient mind gave up its thoughts, / The striving heart its unavailing hopes.

07.05_125:004 - All Knowledge failed and the Idea’s forms, / And Wisdom screened in awe her lowly head / Feeling a Truth too great for thought or speech, / Formless, ineffable, for ever the same.

07.05_125:005 - An innocent and holy Ignorance / Adored like one who worships formless God / The unseen light she could not claim nor own.

07.05_125:006 - In a simple purity of emptiness / Her mind knelt down before the unknowable.

07.05_125:007 - All was abolished save her naked self / And the prostrate yearning of her surrendered heart.

07.05_125:008 - There was no strength in her, no pride of force; / The lofty burning of desire had sunk / Ashamed, a vanity of separate self, / The hope of spiritual greatness fled, / Salvation she asked not nor a heavenly crown: / Humanity seemed now too proud a state.

07.05_125:009 - Her self was nothing, God alone was all, / Yet God she knew not but only knew he was.

07.05_125:010 - A sacred darkness brooded now within, / The world was a deep darkness great and nude.

07.05_125:011 - This Void held more than all the teeming worlds, / This blank felt more than all that Time has borne, / This dark knew dumbly, immensely the Unknown.

07.05_125:012 - But all was formless, voiceless, infinite.

07.05_125:013 - As might a shadow walk in a shadowy scene, / A small naught passing through a mightier Naught, / A night of person in a bare outline / Crossing a fathomless impersonal Night, / Silent she moved, empty and absolute.

07.05_125:014 - In endless Time her soul reached a wide end; / The spaceless vast became her spirit’s place.

07.05_125:015 - At last a change approached, the emptiness broke; / A wave rippled within, the world had stirred; / Once more her inner self became her space.

07.05_125:016 - There was felt a blissful nearness to the Goal; / Heaven leaned low to kiss the sacred hill, / The air trembled with passion and delight.

07.05_125:017 - A rose of splendour on a tree of dreams, / The face of Dawn out of mooned twilight grew.

07.05_125:018 - Day came, priest of a sacrifice of joy / Into the worshipping silence of her world; / He carried a mortal lustre as his robe, / Trailed Heaven like a purple scarf and wore / As his vermilion caste-mark a red sun.

07.05_125:019 - As if an old remembered dream come true, / She recognised in her prophetic mind / The imperishable lustre of that sky, / The tremulous sweetness of that happy air / And, covered from mind’s view and life’s approach, / The mystic cavern in the sacred hill / And knew the dwelling of her secret soul.

07.05_125:020 - As if in some Elysian occult depth, / Truth’s last retreat from thought’s profaning touch, / As if in a rock-temple’s solitude hid, / God’s refuge from an ignorant worshipping world, / It lay withdrawn even from life’s inner sense, / Receding from the entangled heart’s desire.

07.05_125:021 - A marvellous brooding twilight met the eyes / And a holy stillness held that voiceless space.

07.05_125:022 - An awful dimness wrapped the great rock-doors / Carved in the massive stone of Matter’s trance.

07.05_125:023 - Two golden serpents round the lintel curled, / Enveloping it with their pure and dreadful strength, / Looked out with wisdom’s deep and luminous eyes.

07.05_125:024 - An eagle covered it with wide conquering wings.

07.05_125:025 - Flames of self-lost immobile reverie, / Doves crowded the grey musing cornices / Like sculptured postures of white-bosomed peace.

07.05_125:026t - Across the threshold’s sleep she entered in / And found herself amid great figures of gods / Conscious in stone and living without breath, / Watching with fixed regard the soul of man, / Executive figures of the cosmic self, / World-symbols of immutable potency. #archetypal-symbolism #divine-archetypes #divine-care #divine-powers #hidden-truth #spiritual-method #spiritual-truth #symbolism

07.05_125:027 - On the walls covered with significant shapes / Looked at her the life-scene of man and beast / And the high meaning of the life of gods, / The power and necessity of these numberless worlds / And faces of beings and stretches of world-space / Spoke the succinct and inexhaustible / Hieratic message of the climbing planes.

07.05_125:028 - In their immensitude signing infinity / They were the extension of the self of God / And housed, impassively receiving all, / His figures and his small and mighty acts / And his passion and his birth and life and death / And his return to immortality.

07.05_125:029 - To the abiding and eternal is their climb, / To the pure existence everywhere the same, / To the sheer consciousness and the absolute force / And the unimaginable and formless bliss, / To the mirth in Time and the timeless mystery / Of the triune being who is all and one / And yet is no one but himself apart.

07.05_125:030 - There was no step of breathing men, no sound, / Only the living nearness of the soul.

07.05_125:031 - Yet all the worlds and God himself were there, / For every symbol was a reality / And brought the Presence which had given it life.

07.05_125:032 - All this she saw and inly felt and knew / Not by some thought of mind but by the self.

07.05_125:033 - A light not born of sun or moon nor fire, / A light that dwelt within and saw within / Shedding an intimate visibility, / Made secrecy more revealing than the word: / Our sight and sense are a fallible gaze and touch / And only the spirit’s vision is wholly true.

07.05_125:034 - As thus she passed in that mysterious place / Through room and room, through door and rock-hewn door, / She felt herself made one with all she saw.

07.05_125:035 - A sealed identity within her woke; / She knew herself the Beloved of the Supreme: / These Gods and Goddesses were he and she: / The Mother was she of Beauty and Delight, / The Word in Brahma’s vast creating clasp, / The World-Puissance on almighty Shiva’s lap,— / The Master and the Mother of all lives / Watching the worlds their twin regard had made, / And Krishna and Radha for ever entwined in bliss, / The Adorer and Adored self-lost and one.

07.05_125:036 - In the last chamber on a golden seat / One sat whose shape no vision could define, / Only one felt the world’s unattainable fount, / A Power of which she was a straying Force, / An invisible Beauty, goal of the world’s desire, / A Sun of which all knowledge is a beam, / A Greatness without whom no life could be.

07.05_125:037 - Thence all departed into silent self, / And all became formless and pure and bare.

07.05_125:038 - Then through a tunnel dug in the last rock / She came out where there shone a deathless sun.

07.05_125:039 - A house was there all made of flame and light / And crossing a wall of doorless living fire / There suddenly she met her secret soul.



Section I - 126: together and grew one


07.05_126:001 - A being stood immortal in transience, / Deathless dallying with momentary things, / In whose wide eyes of tranquil happiness / Which pity and sorrow could not abrogate / Infinity turned its gaze on finite shapes: / Observer of the silent steps of the hours / And the passing scenes of the Everlasting’s play, / In the mystery of its selecting will, / In the Divine Comedy a participant, / The Spirit’s conscious representative, / God’s delegate in our humanity, / Comrade of the universe, the Transcendent’s ray, / She had come into the mortal body’s room / To play at ball with Time and Circumstance.

07.05_126:002 - A joy in the world her master movement here, / The passion of the game lighted her eyes: / A smile on her lips welcomed earth’s bliss and grief, / A laugh was her return to pleasure and pain.

07.05_126:003 - All things she saw as a masquerade of Truth / Disguised in the costumes of Ignorance, / Crossing the years to immortality: / All she could front with the strong spirit’s peace.

07.05_126:004 - But since she knows the toil of mind and life / As a mother feels and shares her children’s lives, / She puts forth a small portion of herself, / A being no bigger than the thumb of man / Into a hidden region of the heart / To face the pang and to forget the bliss, / To share the suffering and endure earth’s wounds / And labour mid the labour of the stars.

07.05_126:005 - This in us laughs and weeps, suffers the stroke, / Exults in victory, struggles for the crown, / Identified with the mind and body and life, / It takes on itself their anguish and defeat, / Bleeds with Fate’s whips and hangs upon the cross, / Yet is the unwounded and immortal self / Supporting the actor on the human scene.

07.05_126:006 - Through this she sends us her glory and her powers, / Pushes to wisdom’s heights, through misery’s gulfs; / She gives us strength to do our daily task / And sympathy that partakes of others’ grief / And the little strength we have to help our race, / We who must fill the roll of the universe / Acting itself out in a slight human shape / And on our shoulders carry the struggling world.

07.05_126:007 - This is in us the godhead small and marred; / In this human portion of divinity / She seats the greatness of the Soul in Time / To uplift from light to light, from power to power, / Till on a heavenly peak it stands, a king.

07.05_126:008 - In body weak, in its heart an invincible might, / It climbs stumbling, held up by an unseen hand, / A toiling spirit in a mortal shape.

07.05_126:009 - Here in this chamber of flame and light they met; / They looked upon each other, knew themselves, / The secret deity and its human part, / The calm immortal and the struggling soul.

07.05_126:010 - Then with a magic transformation’s speed / They rushed into each other and grew one.



Section I - 127: a living image


07.05_127:001 - Once more she was human upon earthly soil / In the muttering night amid the rain-swept woods / And the rude cottage where she sat in trance: / That subtle world withdrew deeply within / Behind the sun-veil of the inner sight.

07.05_127:002 - But now the half-opened lotus bud of her heart / Had bloomed and stood disclosed to the earthly ray; / In an image shone revealed her secret soul.

07.05_127:003 - There was no wall severing the soul and mind, / No mystic fence guarding from the claims of life.

07.05_127:004 - In its deep lotus home her being sat / As if on concentration’s marble seat, / Calling the mighty Mother of the worlds / To make this earthly tenement her house.

07.05_127:005 - As in a flash from a supernal light, / A living image of the original Power, / A face, a form came down into her heart / And made of it its temple and pure abode.

07.05_127:006 - But when its feet had touched the quivering bloom, / A mighty movement rocked the inner space / As if a world were shaken and found its soul / Out of the Inconscient’s soulless mindless Night: / A flaming serpent rose released from sleep.

07.05_127:007 - It rose billowing its coils and stood erect / And climbing mightily stormily on its way / It touched her centres with its flaming mouth: / As if a fiery kiss had broken their sleep, / They bloomed and laughed surcharged with light and bliss; / Then at the crown it joined the Eternal’s space.

07.05_127:008 - In the flower of the head, in the flower of Matter’s base, / In each divine stronghold and Nature-knot / It held together the mystic stream which joins / The viewless summits with the unseen depths, / The string of forts that make the frail defence / Safeguarding us against the enormous world.

07.05_127:009 - Our lines of self-expression in its Vast, / An image sat of the original Power / Wearing the mighty Mother’s form and face.

07.05_127:010 - Armed, bearer of the weapon and the sign / Whose occult might no magic can imitate, / Manifold yet one she sat, a guardian force: / A saviour gesture stretched her lifted arm, / And symbol of some native cosmic strength, / A sacred beast lay prone below her feet, / A silent flame-eyed mass of living force.

07.05_127:011 - All underwent a high celestial change: / Breaking the black Inconscient’s blind mute wall, / Effacing the circles of the Ignorance, / Powers and divinities burst flaming forth; / Each part of the being trembling with delight / Lay overwhelmed with tides of happiness / And saw her hand in every circumstance / And felt her touch in every limb and cell: / In the country of the lotus of the head / Which thinking mind has made its busy space, / In the castle of the lotus twixt the brows / Whence it shoots the arrows of its sight and will, / In the passage of the lotus of the throat / Where speech must rise and the expressing mind / And the heart’s impulse run towards word and fact, / A glad uplift and a new working came.

07.05_127:012 - The immortal’s thoughts displaced our bounded view, / The immortal’s thoughts earth’s drab idea and sense; / All things now bore a deeper heavenlier sense.

07.05_127:013 - A glad clear harmony marked their truth’s outline, / Re-set the balance and measures of the world.

07.05_127:014 - Each shape showed its occult design, unveiled / God’s meaning in it for which it was made / And the vivid splendour of his artist thought.

07.05_127:015 - A channel of the mighty Mother’s choice, / The immortal’s will took into its calm control / Our blind or erring government of life; / A loose republic once of wants and needs, / Then bowed to the uncertain sovereign mind, / Life now obeyed to a diviner rule / And every act became an act of God.

07.05_127:016 - In the kingdom of the lotus of the heart / Love chanting its pure hymeneal hymn / Made life and body mirrors of sacred joy / And all the emotions gave themselves to God.

07.05_127:017 - In the navel lotus’s broad imperial range / Its proud ambitions and its master lusts / Were tamed into instruments of a great calm sway / To do a work of God on earthly soil.

07.05_127:018 - In the narrow nether centres’ petty parts / Its childish game of daily dwarf desires / Was changed into a sweet and boisterous play, / A romp of little gods with life in Time.

07.05_127:019 - In the deep place where once the Serpent slept, / There came a grip on Matter’s giant powers / For large utilities in life’s little space; / A firm ground was made for Heaven’s descending might.

07.05_127:020 - Behind all reigned her sovereign deathless soul: / Casting aside its veil of Ignorance, / Allied to gods and cosmic beings and powers / It built the harmony of its human state; / Surrendered into the great World-Mother’s hands / Only she obeyed her sole supreme behest / In the enigma of the Inconscient’s world.

07.05_127:021 - A secret soul behind supporting all / Is master and witness of our ignorant life, / Admits the Person’s look and Nature’s role.

07.05_127:022 - But once the hidden doors are flung apart / Then the veiled king steps out in Nature’s front; / A Light comes down into the Ignorance, / Its heavy painful knot loosens its grasp: / The mind becomes a mastered instrument / And life a hue and figure of the soul.

07.05_127:023 - All happy grows towards knowledge and towards bliss.

07.05_127:024 - A divine Puissance then takes Nature’s place / And pushes the movements of our body and mind; / Possessor of our passionate hopes and dreams, / The beloved despot of our thoughts and acts, / She streams into us with her unbound force, / Into mortal limbs the Immortal’s rapture and power.

07.05_127:025 - An inner law of beauty shapes our lives; / Our words become the natural speech of Truth, / Each thought is a ripple on a sea of Light.

07.05_127:026 - Then sin and virtue leave the cosmic lists; / They struggle no more in our delivered hearts: / Our acts chime with God’s simple natural good / Or serve the rule of a supernal Right.

07.05_127:027 - All moods unlovely, evil and untrue / Forsake their stations in fierce disarray / And hide their shame in the subconscient’s dusk; / Then lifts the mind a cry of victory: / “O soul, my soul, we have created Heaven, / Within we have found the kingdom here of God, / His fortress built in a loud ignorant world.

07.05_127:028 - Our life is entrenched between two rivers of Light, / We have turned space into a gulf of peace / And made the body a capitol of bliss.

07.05_127:029 - What more, what more, if more must still be done?”

07.05_127:030 - In the slow process of the evolving spirit, / In the brief stade between a death and birth / A first perfection’s stage is reached at last; / Out of the wood and stone of our nature’s stuff / A temple is shaped where the high gods could live.

07.05_127:031 - Even if the struggling world is left outside / One man’s perfection still can save the world.

07.05_127:032 - There is won a new proximity to the skies, / A first betrothal of the Earth to Heaven, / A deep concordat between Truth and Life: / A camp of God is pitched in human time.


Canto 6 - 7.6: Nirvana and the Discovery of the All-Negating Absolute

Section I - 128: the Abyss drew Heaven's reply


07.06_128:001 - A calm slow sun looked down from tranquil heavens.

07.06_128:002 - A routed sullen rearguard of retreat, / The last rains had fled murmuring across the woods / Or failed, a sibilant whisper mid the leaves, / And the great blue enchantment of the sky / Recovered the deep rapture of its smile.

07.06_128:003 - Its mellow splendour unstressed by storm-licked heats / Found room for a luxury of warm mild days, / The night’s gold treasure of autumnal moons / Came floating shipped through ripples of fairy air.

07.06_128:004 - And Savitri’s life was glad, fulfilled like earth’s; / She had found herself, she knew her being’s aim.

07.06_128:005 - Although her kingdom of marvellous change within / Remained unspoken in her secret breast, / All that lived round her felt its magic’s charm: / The trees’ rustling voices told it to the winds, / Flowers spoke in ardent hues an unknown joy, / The birds’ carolling became a canticle, / The beasts forgot their strife and lived at ease.

07.06_128:006 - Absorbed in wide communion with the Unseen / The mild ascetics of the wood received / A sudden greatening of their lonely muse.

07.06_128:007 - This bright perfection of her inner state / Poured overflowing into her outward scene, / Made beautiful dull common natural things / And action wonderful and time divine.

07.06_128:008 - Even the smallest meanest work became / A sweet or glad and glorious sacrament, / An offering to the self of the great world / Or a service to the One in each and all.

07.06_128:009 - A light invaded all from her being’s light; / Her heart-beats’ dance communicated bliss: / Happiness grew happier, shared with her, by her touch / And grief some solace found when she drew near.

07.06_128:010 - Above the cherished head of Satyavan / She saw not now Fate’s dark and lethal orb; / A golden circle round a mystic sun / Disclosed to her new-born predicting sight / The cyclic rondure of a sovereign life.

07.06_128:011 - In her visions and deep-etched veridical dreams, / In brief shiftings of the future’s heavy screen, / He lay not by a dolorous decree / A victim in the dismal antre of death / Or borne to blissful regions far from her / Forgetting the sweetness of earth’s warm delight, / Forgetting the passionate oneness of love’s clasp, / Absolved in the self-rapt immortal’s bliss.

07.06_128:012 - Always he was with her, a living soul / That met her eyes with close enamoured eyes, / A living body near to her body’s joy.

07.06_128:013 - But now no longer in these great wild woods / In kinship with the days of bird and beast / And levelled to the bareness of earth’s brown breast, / But mid the thinking high-built lives of men / In tapestried chambers and on crystal floors, / In armoured town or gardened pleasure-walks, / Even in distance closer than her thoughts, / Body to body near, soul near to soul, / Moving as if by a common breath and will, / They were tied in the single circling of their days / Together by love’s unseen atmosphere, / Inseparable like the earth and sky.

07.06_128:014 - Thus for a while she trod the Golden Path; / This was the sun before abysmal Night.

07.06_128:015 - Once as she sat in deep felicitous muse, / Still quivering from her lover’s strong embrace, / And made her joy a bridge twixt earth and heaven, / An abyss yawned suddenly beneath her heart.

07.06_128:016 - A vast and nameless fear dragged at her nerves / As drags a wild beast its half-slaughtered prey; / It seemed to have no den from which it sprang: / It was not hers, but hid its unseen cause.

07.06_128:017 - Then rushing came its vast and fearful Fount.

07.06_128:018 - A formless Dread with shapeless endless wings / Filling the universe with its dangerous breath, / A denser darkness than the Night could bear, / Enveloped the heavens and possessed the earth.

07.06_128:019 - A rolling surge of silent death, it came / Curving round the far edge of the quaking globe; / Effacing heaven with its enormous stride / It willed to expunge the choked and anguished air / And end the fable of the joy of life.

07.06_128:020 - It seemed her very being to forbid / Abolishing all by which her nature lived / And laboured to blot out her body and soul, / A clutch of some half-seen Invisible, / An ocean of terror and of sovereign might, / A person and a black Infinity.

07.06_128:021 - It seemed to cry to her without thought or word / The message of its dark eternity / And the awful meaning of its silences: / Out of some sullen monstrous vast arisen, / Out of an abysmal deep of grief and fear / Imagined by some blind regardless self, / A consciousness of being without its joy, / Empty of thought, incapable of bliss, / That felt life blank and nowhere found a soul, / A voice to the dumb anguish of the heart / Conveyed a stark sense of unspoken words; / In her own depths she heard the unuttered thought / That made unreal the world and all life meant.

07.06_128:022 - “Who art thou who claim’st thy crown or separate birth, / The illusion of thy soul’s reality / And personal godhead on an ignorant globe / In the animal body of imperfect man?

07.06_128:023 - Hope not to be happy in a world of pain / And dream not, listening to the unspoken Word / And dazzled by the inexpressible Ray, / Transcending the mute Superconscient’s realm / To give a body to the Unknowable, / Or for a sanction to thy heart’s delight / To burden with bliss the silent still Supreme, / Profaning its bare and formless sanctity, / Or call into thy chamber the Divine / And sit with God tasting a human joy.

07.06_128:024 - I have created all, all I devour; / I am Death and the dark terrible Mother of life, / I am Kali black and naked in the world, / I am Maya and the universe is my cheat.

07.06_128:025 - I lay waste human happiness with my breath / And slay the will to live, the joy to be / That all may pass back into nothingness / And only abide the eternal and absolute.

07.06_128:026 - For only the blank Eternal can be true.

07.06_128:027 - All else is shadow and flash in Mind’s bright glass, / Mind, hollow mirror in which Ignorance sees / A splendid figure of its own false Self / And dreams it sees a glorious solid world.

07.06_128:028 - O soul, inventor of man’s thoughts and hopes, / Thyself the invention of the moments’ stream, / Illusion’s centre or subtle apex point, / At last know thyself, from vain existence cease.”

07.06_128:029 - A shadow of the negating Absolute, / The intolerant Darkness travelled surging past / And ebbed in her the formidable Voice.

07.06_128:030 - It left behind her inner world laid waste: / A barren silence weighed upon her heart, / Her kingdom of delight was there no more; / Only her soul remained, its emptied stage, / Awaiting the unknown eternal Will.

07.06_128:031 - Then from the heights a greater Voice came down, / The Word that touches the heart and finds the soul, / The voice of Light after the voice of Night: / The cry of the Abyss drew Heaven’s reply, / A might of storm chased by the might of the Sun: / “O Soul, bare not thy kingdom to the foe; / Consent to hide thy royalty of bliss / Lest Time and Fate find out its avenues / And beat with thunderous knock upon thy gates.

07.06_128:032 - Hide whilst thou canst thy treasure of separate self / Behind the luminous rampart of thy depths / Till of a vaster empire it grows part.

07.06_128:033 - But not for self alone the self is won: / Content abide not with one conquered realm; / Adventure all to make the whole world thine, / To break into greater kingdoms turn thy force.

07.06_128:034 - Fear not to be nothing that thou mayst be all; / Assent to the emptiness of the Supreme / That all in thee may reach its absolute.

07.06_128:035 - Accept to be small and human on the earth, / Interrupting thy new-born divinity, / That man may find his utter self in God.

07.06_128:036 - If for thy own sake only thou hast come, / An immortal spirit into the mortal’s world, / To found thy luminous kingdom in God’s dark, / In the Inconscient’s realm one shining star, / One door in the Ignorance opened upon light, / Why hadst thou any need to come at all?

07.06_128:037 - Thou hast come down into a struggling world / To aid a blind and suffering mortal race, / To open to Light the eyes that could not see, / To bring down bliss into the heart of grief, / To make thy life a bridge twixt earth and heaven; / If thou wouldst save the toiling universe, / The vast universal suffering feel as thine: / Thou must bear the sorrow that thou claim’st to heal; / The day-bringer must walk in darkest night.

07.06_128:038 - He who would save the world must share its pain.

07.06_128:039 - If he knows not grief, how shall he find grief’s cure?

07.06_128:040 - If far he walks above mortality’s head, / How shall the mortal reach that too high path?

07.06_128:041 - If one of theirs they see scale heaven’s peaks, / Men then can hope to learn that titan climb.

07.06_128:042 - God must be born on earth and be as man / That man being human may grow even as God.

07.06_128:043 - He who would save the world must be one with the world, / All suffering things contain in his heart’s space / And bear the grief and joy of all that lives.

07.06_128:044 - His soul must be wider than the universe / And feel eternity as its very stuff, / Rejecting the moment’s personality, / Know itself older than the birth of Time, / Creation an incident in its consciousness, / Arcturus and Belphegor grains of fire / Circling in a corner of its boundless self, / The world’s destruction a small transient storm / In the calm infinity it has become.

07.06_128:045 - If thou wouldst a little loosen the vast chain, / Draw back from the world that the Idea has made, / Thy mind’s selection from the Infinite, / Thy senses’ gloss on the Infinitesimal’s dance, / Then shalt thou know how the great bondage came.

07.06_128:046 - Banish all thought from thee and be God’s void.

07.06_128:047 - Then shalt thou uncover the Unknowable / And the Superconscient conscious grow on thy tops; / Infinity’s vision through thy gaze shall pierce, / Thou shalt look into the eyes of the Unknown; / Find the hid Truth in things seen null and false, / Behind things known discover Mystery’s rear.

07.06_128:048 - Thou shalt be one with God’s bare reality / And the miraculous world he has become / And the diviner miracle still to be / When Nature who is now unconscious God / Translucent grows to the Eternal’s light, / Her seeing his sight, her walk his steps of power / And life is filled with a spiritual joy / And Matter is the Spirit’s willing bride.

07.06_128:049 - Consent to be nothing and none, dissolve Time’s work, / Cast off thy mind, step back from form and name.

07.06_128:050 - Annul thyself that only God may be.”



Section I - 129: Laboratory of God


07.06_129:001 - Thus spoke the mighty and uplifting Voice, / And Savitri heard; she bowed her head and mused / Plunging her deep regard into herself / In her soul’s privacy in the silent Night.

07.06_129:002 - Aloof and standing back detached and calm, / A witness of the drama of herself, / A student of her own interior scene, / She watched the passion and the toil of life / And heard in the crowded thoroughfares of mind / The unceasing tread and passage of her thoughts.

07.06_129:003 - All she allowed to rise that chose to stir; / Calling, compelling nought, forbidding nought, / She left all to the process formed in Time / And the free initiative of Nature’s will.

07.06_129:004 - Thus following the complex human play / She heard the prompter’s voice behind the scenes, / Perceived the original libretto’s set / And the organ theme of the composer Force.

07.06_129:005 - All she beheld that surges from man’s depths, / The animal instincts prowling mid life’s trees, / The impulses that whisper to the heart / And passion’s thunder-chase sweeping the nerves; / She saw the Powers that stare from the Abyss / And the wordless Light that liberates the soul.

07.06_129:006 - But most her gaze pursued the birth of thought.

07.06_129:007 - Affranchised from the look of surface mind / She paused not to survey the official case, / The issue of forms from the office of the brain, / Its factory of thought-sounds and soundless words / And voices stored within unheard by men, / Its mint and treasury of shining coin.

07.06_129:008 - These were but counters in mind’s symbol game, / A gramophone’s discs, a reproduction’s film, / A list of signs, a cipher and a code.

07.06_129:009 - In our unseen subtle body thought is born / Or there it enters from the cosmic field.

07.06_129:010 - Oft from her soul stepped out a naked thought / Luminous with mysteried lips and wonderful eyes; / Or from her heart emerged some burning face / And looked for life and love and passionate truth, / Aspired to heaven or embraced the world / Or led the fancy like a fleeting moon / Across the dull sky of man’s common days, / Amidst the doubtful certitudes of earth’s lore, / To the celestial beauty of faith gave form / As if at flower-prints in a dingy room / Laughed in a golden vase one living rose.

07.06_129:011 - A thaumaturgist sat in her heart’s deep, / Compelled the forward stride, the upward look, / Till wonder leapt into the illumined breast / And life grew marvellous with transfiguring hope.

07.06_129:012 - A seeing will pondered between the brows; / Thoughts, glistening Angels stood behind the brain / In flashing armour, folding hands of prayer, / And poured heaven’s rays into the earthly form.

07.06_129:013 - Imaginations flamed up from her breast, / Unearthly beauty, touches of surpassing joy / And plans of miracle, dreams of delight: / Around her navel lotus clustering close / Her large sensations of the teeming worlds / Streamed their dumb movements of the unformed Idea; / Invading the small sensitive flower of the throat / They brought their mute, unuttered resonances / To kindle the figures of a heavenly speech.

07.06_129:014 - Below, desires formed their wordless wish, / And longings of physical sweetness and ecstasy / Translated into the accents of a cry / Their grasp on objects and their clasp on souls.

07.06_129:015 - Her body’s thoughts climbed from her conscious limbs / And carried their yearnings to its mystic crown / Where Nature’s murmurs meet the Ineffable.

07.06_129:016 - But for the mortal prisoned in outward mind / All must present their passports at its door; / Disguised they must don the official cap and mask / Or pass as manufactures of the brain, / Unknown their secret truth and hidden source.

07.06_129:017 - Only to the inner mind they speak direct, / Put on a body and assume a voice, / Their passage seen, their message heard and known, / Their birthplace and their natal mark revealed, / And stand confessed to an immortal’s sight, / Our nature’s messengers to the witness soul.

07.06_129:018 - Impenetrable, withheld from mortal sense, / The inner chambers of the spirit’s house / Disclosed to her their happenings and their guests; / Eyes looked through crevices in the invisible wall / And through the secrecy of the unseen doors / There came into mind’s little frontal room / Thoughts that enlarged our limited human range, / Lifted the ideal’s half-quenched or sinking torch / Or peered through the finite at the infinite.

07.06_129:019 - A sight opened upon the invisible / And sensed the shapes that mortal eyes see not, / The sounds that mortal listening cannot hear, / The blissful sweetness of the intangible’s touch, / The objects that to us are empty air / Are there the stuff of daily experience / And the common pabulum of sense and thought.

07.06_129:020 - The beings of the subtle realms appeared / And scenes concealed behind our earthly scene; / She saw the life of remote continents / And distance deafen not to voices far; / She felt the movements crossing unknown minds; / The past’s events occurred before her eyes.

07.06_129:021 - The great world’s thoughts were part of her own thoughts, / The feelings dumb for ever and unshared, / The ideas that never found an utterance, / The dim subconscient’s incoherent hints / Laid bare a meaning twisted deep and strange, / The bizarre secret of their grumbling speech, / Their links with underlying reality.

07.06_129:022 - The unseen grew visible and audible: / Thoughts leaped down from a superconscient field / Like eagles swooping from a viewless peak, / Thoughts gleamed up from the screened subliminal depths / Like golden fishes from a hidden sea.

07.06_129:023 - This world is a vast unbroken totality, / A deep solidarity joins its contrary powers.

07.06_129:024 - God’s summits look back on the mute Abyss.

07.06_129:025 - So man evolving to divinest heights / Colloques still with the animal and the Djinn; / The human godhead with star-gazer eyes / Lives still in one house with the primal beast.

07.06_129:026 - The high meets the low, all is a single plan.

07.06_129:027 - So she beheld the many births of thought, / If births can be of what eternal is; / For the Eternal’s powers are like himself, / Timeless in the Timeless, in Time ever born.

07.06_129:028 - This too she saw that all in outer mind / Is made, not born, a product perishable, / Forged in the body’s factory by earth-force.

07.06_129:029 - This mind is a dynamic small machine / Producing ceaselessly till it wears out, / With raw material drawn from the outside world, / The patterns sketched out by an artist God.

07.06_129:030 - Often our thoughts are finished cosmic wares / Admitted by a silent office gate / And passed through the subconscient galleries, / Then issued in Time’s mart as private make.

07.06_129:031 - For now they bear the living person’s stamp; / A trick, a special hue claims them his own.

07.06_129:032 - All else is Nature’s craft and this too hers.

07.06_129:033 - Our tasks are given, we are but instruments; / Nothing is all our own that we create; / The Power that acts in us is not our force: / The genius too receives from some high fount / Concealed in a supernal secrecy / The work that gives him an immortal name.

07.06_129:034 - The word, the form, the charm, the glory and grace / Are missioned sparks from a stupendous Fire; / A sample from the laboratory of God / Of which he holds the patent upon earth, / Comes to him wrapt in golden coverings; / He listens for Inspiration’s postman knock / And takes delivery of the priceless gift / A little spoilt by the receiver mind / Or mixed with the manufacture of his brain; / When least defaced, then is it most divine.

07.06_129:035 - Although his ego claims the world for its use, / Man is a dynamo for the cosmic work; / Nature does most in him, God the high rest: / Only his soul’s acceptance is his own.

07.06_129:036 - This independent, once a power supreme, / Self-born before the universe was made, / Accepting cosmos, binds himself Nature’s serf / Till he becomes her freed man—or God’s slave.

07.06_129:037 - This is the appearance in our mortal front; / Our greater truth of being lies behind: / Our consciousness is cosmic and immense, / But only when we break through Matter’s wall / In that spiritual vastness can we stand / Where we can live the masters of our world, / And mind is only a means and body a tool.

07.06_129:038 - For above the birth of body and of thought / Our spirit’s truth lives in the naked self / And from that height, unbound, surveys the world.

07.06_129:039 - Out of the mind she rose to escape its law / That it might sleep in some deep shadow of self / Or fall silent in the silence of the Unseen.

07.06_129:040 - High she attained and stood from Nature free / And saw creation’s life from far above, / Thence upon all she laid her sovereign will / To dedicate it to God’s timeless calm: / Then all grew tranquil in her being’s space, / Only sometimes small thoughts arose and fell / Like quiet waves upon a silent sea / Or ripples passing over a lonely pool / When a stray stone disturbs its dreaming rest.

07.06_129:041 - Yet the mind’s factory had ceased to work, / There was no sound of the dynamo’s throb, / There came no call from the still fields of life.

07.06_129:042 - Then even those stirrings rose in her no more; / Her mind now seemed like a vast empty room / Or like a peaceful landscape without sound.

07.06_129:043 - This men call quietude and prize as peace.

07.06_129:044 - But to her deeper sight all yet was there, / Effervescing like a chaos under a lid; / Feelings and thoughts cried out for word and act / But found no response in the silenced brain: / All was suppressed but nothing yet expunged; / At every moment might explosion come.

07.06_129:045 - Then this too paused; the body seemed a stone.

07.06_129:046 - All now was a wide mighty vacancy, / But still excluded from eternity’s hush; / For still was far the repose of the Absolute / And the ocean silence of Infinity.

07.06_129:047 - Even now some thoughts could cross her solitude: / These surged not from the depths or from within / Cast up from formlessness to seek a form, / Spoke not the body’s need nor voiced mind’s call.

07.06_129:048 - These seemed not born nor made in human Time, / Children of cosmic nature from a far world, / Idea’s shapes in complete armour of words / Posted like travellers in an alien space.

07.06_129:049 - Out of some far expanse they seemed to come / As if carried on vast wings like large white sails, / And with easy access reached the inner ear / As though they used a natural privileged right / To the high royal entries of the soul.

07.06_129:050 - As yet their path lay deep concealed in light.

07.06_129:051 - Then looking to know whence the intruders came / She saw a spiritual immensity / Pervading and encompassing the world-space / As ether our transparent tangible air, / And through it sailing tranquilly a thought.

07.06_129:052 - As smoothly glides a ship nearing its port, / Ignorant of embargo and blockade, / Confident of entrance and the visa’s seal, / It came to the silent city of the brain / Towards its accustomed and expectant quay, / But met a barring will, a blow of Force / And sank vanishing in the immensity.

07.06_129:053 - After a long vacant pause another appeared / And others one by one suddenly emerged, / Mind’s unexpected visitors from the unseen / Like far-off sails upon a lonely sea.

07.06_129:054 - But soon that commerce failed, none reached mind’s coast.

07.06_129:055 - Then all grew still, nothing moved any more: / Immobile, self-rapt, timeless, solitary / A silent spirit pervaded silent Space.



Section I - 130: Beyond Gods day and Gods night


07.06_130:001 - In that absolute stillness bare and formidable / There was glimpsed an all-negating Void supreme / That claimed its mystic Nihil’s sovereign right / To cancel Nature and deny the soul.

07.06_130:002 - Even the nude sense of self grew pale and thin: / Impersonal, signless, featureless, void of forms / A blank pure consciousness had replaced the mind.

07.06_130:003 - Her spirit seemed the substance of a name, / The world a pictured symbol drawn on self, / A dream of images, a dream of sounds / Built up the semblance of a universe / Or lent to spirit the appearance of a world.

07.06_130:004 - This was self-seeing; in that intolerant hush / No notion and no concept could take shape, / There was no sense to frame the figure of things, / A sheer self-sight was there, no thought arose.

07.06_130:005 - Emotion slept deep down in the still heart / Or lay buried in a cemetery of peace: / All feelings seemed quiescent, calm or dead, / As if the heart-strings rent could work no more / And joy and grief could never rise again.

07.06_130:006 - The heart beat on with an unconscious rhythm / But no response came from it and no cry.

07.06_130:007 - Vain was the provocation of events; / Nothing within answered an outside touch, / No nerve was stirred and no reaction rose.

07.06_130:008 - Yet still her body saw and moved and spoke; / It understood without the aid of thought, / It said whatever needed to be said, / It did whatever needed to be done.

07.06_130:009 - There was no person there behind the act, / No mind that chose or passed the fitting word: / All wrought like an unerring apt machine.

07.06_130:010 - As if continuing old habitual turns, / And pushed by an old unexhausted force / The engine did the work for which it was made: / Her consciousness looked on and took no part; / All it upheld, in nothing had a share.

07.06_130:011 - There was no strong initiator will; / An incoherence crossing a firm void / Slipped into an order of related chance.

07.06_130:012 - A pure perception was the only power / That stood behind her action and her sight.

07.06_130:013 - If that retired, all objects would be extinct, / Her private universe would cease to be, / The house she had built with bricks of thought and sense / In the beginning after the birth of Space.

07.06_130:014 - This seeing was identical with the seen; / It knew without knowledge all that could be known, / It saw impartially the world go by, / But in the same supreme unmoving glance / Saw too its abysmal unreality.

07.06_130:015 - It watched the figure of the cosmic game, / But the thought and inner life in forms seemed dead / Abolished by her own collapse of thought: / A hollow physical shell persisted still.

07.06_130:016 - All seemed a brilliant shadow of itself, / A cosmic film of scenes and images: / The enduring mass and outline of the hills / Was a design sketched on a silent mind / And held to a tremulous false solidity / By constant beats of visionary sight; / The forest with its emerald multitudes / Clothed with its show of hues vague empty Space, / A painting’s colours hiding a surface void / That flickered upon dissolution’s edge; / The blue heavens, an illusion of the eyes, / Roofed in the mind’s illusion of a world.

07.06_130:017 - The men who walked beneath an unreal sky / Seemed mobile puppets out of cardboard cut / And pushed by unseen hands across the soil / Or moving pictures upon Fancy’s film: / There was no soul within, no power of life.

07.06_130:018 - The brain’s vibrations that appear like thought, / The nerve’s brief answer to each contact’s knock, / The heart’s quiverings felt as joy and grief and love / Were twitchings of the body, their seeming self, / That body forged from atoms and formed gas / A manufactured lie of Maya’s make, / Its life a dream seen by the sleeping Void.

07.06_130:019 - The animals lone or trooping through the glades / Fled like a passing vision of beauty and grace / Imagined by some all-creating Eye.

07.06_130:020 - Yet something was there behind the fading scene; / Wherever she turned, at whatsoever she looked, / It was perceived, yet hid from mind and sight.

07.06_130:021 - The One only real shut itself from Space / And stood aloof from the idea of Time.

07.06_130:022 - Its truth escaped from shape and line and hue.

07.06_130:023 - All else grew unsubstantial, self-annulled, / This only everlasting seemed and true, / Yet nowhere dwelt, it was outside the hours.

07.06_130:024 - This only could justify the labour of sight, / But sight could not define for it a form; / This only could appease the unsatisfied ear / But hearing listened in vain for a missing sound; / This answered not the sense, called not to Mind.

07.06_130:025 - It met her as the uncaught inaudible Voice / That speaks for ever from the Unknowable.

07.06_130:026 - It met her like an omnipresent point / Pure of dimensions, unfixed, invisible, / The single oneness of its multiplied beat / Accentuating its sole eternity.

07.06_130:027 - It faced her as some vast Nought’s immensity, / An endless No to all that seems to be, / An endless Yes to things ever unconceived / And all that is unimagined and unthought, / An eternal zero or untotalled Aught, / A spaceless and a placeless Infinite.

07.06_130:028 - Yet eternity and infinity seemed but words / Vainly affixed by mind’s incompetence / To its stupendous lone reality.

07.06_130:029 - The world is but a spark-burst from its light, / All moments flashes from its Timelessness, / All objects glimmerings of the Bodiless / That disappear from Mind when That is seen.

07.06_130:030 - It held, as if a shield before its face, / A consciousness that saw without a seer, / The Truth where knowledge is not nor knower nor known, / The Love enamoured of its own delight / In which the Lover is not nor the Beloved / Bringing their personal passion into the Vast, / The Force omnipotent in quietude, / The Bliss that none can ever hope to taste.

07.06_130:031 - It cancelled the convincing cheat of self; / A truth in nothingness was its mighty clue.

07.06_130:032 - If all existence could renounce to be / And Being take refuge in Non-being’s arms / And Non-being could strike out its ciphered round, / Some lustre of that Reality might appear.

07.06_130:033 - A formless liberation came on her.

07.06_130:034 - Once sepulchred alive in brain and flesh / She had risen up from body, mind and life; / She was no more a Person in a world, / She had escaped into infinity.

07.06_130:035 - What once had been herself had disappeared; / There was no frame of things, no figure of soul.

07.06_130:036 - A refugee from the domain of sense, / Evading the necessity of thought, / Delivered from Knowledge and from Ignorance / And rescued from the true and the untrue, / She shared the Superconscient’s high retreat / Beyond the self-born Word, the nude Idea, / The first bare solid ground of consciousness; / Beings were not there, existence had no place, / There was no temptation of the joy to be.

07.06_130:037 - Unutterably effaced, no one and null, / A vanishing vestige like a violet trace, / A faint record merely of a self now past, / She was a point in the unknowable.

07.06_130:038 - Only some last annulment now remained, / Annihilation’s vague indefinable step: / A memory of being still was there / And kept her separate from nothingness: / She was in That but still became not That.

07.06_130:039 - This shadow of herself so close to nought / Could be again self’s point d’appui to live, / Return out of the Inconceivable / And be what some mysterious vast might choose.

07.06_130:040 - Even as the Unknowable decreed, / She might be nought or new-become the All, / Or if the omnipotent Nihil took a shape / Emerge as someone and redeem the world.

07.06_130:041 - Even, she might learn what the mystic cipher held, / This seeming exit or closed end of all / Could be a blind tenebrous passage screened from sight, / Her state the eclipsing shell of a darkened sun / On its secret way to the Ineffable.

07.06_130:042 - Even now her splendid being might flame back / Out of the silence and the nullity, / A gleaming portion of the All-Wonderful, / A power of some all-affirming Absolute, / A shining mirror of the eternal Truth / To show to the One-in-all its manifest face, / To the souls of men their deep identity.

07.06_130:043 - Or she might wake into God’s quietude / Beyond the cosmic day and cosmic night / And rest appeased in his white eternity.

07.06_130:044 - But this was now unreal or remote / Or covered in the mystic fathomless blank.

07.06_130:045 - In infinite Nothingness was the ultimate sign / Or else the Real was the Unknowable.

07.06_130:046 - A lonely Absolute negated all: / It effaced the ignorant world from its solitude / And drowned the soul in its everlasting peace.


Canto 7 - 7.7: The Discovery of the Cosmic Spirit and the Cosmic Consciousness

Section I - 131: Earth's unchanged face


07.07_131:001 - In the little hermitage in the forest’s heart, / In the sunlight and the moonlight and the dark / The daily human life went plodding on / Even as before with its small unchanging works / And its spare outward body of routine / And happy quiet of ascetic peace.

07.07_131:002 - The old beauty smiled of the terrestrial scene; / She too was her old gracious self to men.

07.07_131:003 - The Ancient Mother clutched her child to her breast / Pressing her close in her environing arms, / As if earth ever the same could for ever keep / The living spirit and body in her clasp, / As if death were not there nor end nor change.

07.07_131:004 - Accustomed only to read outward signs / None saw aught new in her, none divined her state; / They saw a person where was only God’s vast, / A still being or a mighty nothingness.

07.07_131:005 - To all she was the same perfect Savitri: / A greatness and a sweetness and a light / Poured out from her upon her little world.

07.07_131:006 - Life showed to all the same familiar face, / Her acts followed the old unaltered round, / She spoke the words that she was wont to speak / And did the things that she had always done.

07.07_131:007 - Her eyes looked out on earth’s unchanging face, / Around her soul’s muteness all moved as of old, / A vacant consciousness watched from within / Empty of all but bare Reality.

07.07_131:008 - There was no will behind the word and act, / No thought formed in her brain to guide the speech: / An impersonal emptiness walked and spoke in her, / Something perhaps unfelt, unseen, unknown / Guarded the body for its future work, / Or Nature moved in her old stream of force.

07.07_131:009 - Perhaps she bore made conscious in her breast / The miraculous Nihil, origin of our souls / And source and sum of the vast world’s events, / The womb and grave of thought, a cipher of God, / A zero circle of being’s totality.

07.07_131:010 - It used her speech and acted in her acts, / It was beauty in her limbs, life in her breath; / The original Mystery wore her human face.

07.07_131:011 - Thus was she lost within to separate self; / Her mortal ego perished in God’s night.

07.07_131:012 - Only a body was left, the ego’s shell / Afloat mid drift and foam of the world-sea, / A sea of dream watched by a motionless sense / In a figure of unreal reality.

07.07_131:013 - An impersonal foresight could already see,— / In the unthinking knowledge of the spirit / Even now it seemed nigh done, inevitable,— / The individual die, the cosmos pass; / These gone, the transcendental grew a myth, / The Holy Ghost without the Father and Son, / Or, a substratum of what once had been, / Being that never willed to bear a world / Restored to its original loneliness, / Impassive, sole, silent, intangible.

07.07_131:014 - Yet all was not extinct in this deep loss; / The being travelled not towards nothingness.

07.07_131:015 - There was some high surpassing Secrecy, / And when she sat alone with Satyavan, / Her moveless mind with his that searched and strove, / In the hush of the profound and intimate night / She turned to the face of a veiled voiceless Truth / Hid in the dumb recesses of the heart / Or waiting beyond the last peak climbed by Thought,— / Unseen itself it sees the struggling world / And prompts our quest, but cares not to be found,— / Out of that distant Vast came a reply.

07.07_131:016 - Something unknown, unreached, inscrutable / Sent down the messages of its bodiless Light, / Cast lightning flashes of a thought not ours, / Crossing the immobile silence of her mind: / In its might of irresponsible sovereignty / It seized on speech to give those flamings shape, / Made beat the heart of wisdom in a word / And spoke immortal things through mortal lips.

07.07_131:017 - Or, listening to the sages of the woods, / In question and in answer broke from her / High strange revealings impossible to men, / Something or someone secret and remote / Took hold of her body for his mystic use, / Her mouth was seized to channel ineffable truths, / Knowledge unthinkable found an utterance.

07.07_131:018 - Astonished by a new enlightenment, / Invaded by a streak of the Absolute, / They marvelled at her, for she seemed to know / What they had only glimpsed at times afar.

07.07_131:019 - These thoughts were formed not in her listening brain, / Her vacant heart was like a stringless harp; / Impassive the body claimed not its own voice, / But let the luminous greatness through it pass.

07.07_131:020 - A dual Power at being’s occult poles / Still acted, nameless and invisible: / Her divine emptiness was their instrument.

07.07_131:021 - Inconscient Nature dealt with the world it had made, / And using still the body’s instruments / Slipped through the conscious void she had become; / The superconscient Mystery through that Void / Missioned its word to touch the thoughts of men.

07.07_131:022 - As yet this great impersonal speech was rare.

07.07_131:023 - But now the unmoving wide spiritual space / In which her mind survived tranquil and bare, / Admitted a traveller from the cosmic breadths: / A thought came through draped as an outer voice.

07.07_131:024 - It called not for the witness of the mind, / It spoke not to the hushed receiving heart; / It came direct to the pure perception’s seat, / An only centre now of consciousness, / If centre could be where all seemed only space; / No more shut in by body’s walls and gates, / Her being a circle without circumference / Already now surpassed all cosmic bounds / And more and more spread into infinity.

07.07_131:025 - This being was its own unbounded world, / A world without form or feature or circumstance, / It had no ground, no wall, no roof of thought, / Yet saw itself and looked on all around / In a silence motionless and illimitable.

07.07_131:026 - There was no person there, no centred mind, / No seat of feeling on which beat events / Or objects wrought and shaped reaction’s stress.

07.07_131:027 - There was no motion in this inner world, / All was a still and even infinity.

07.07_131:028 - In her the Unseen, the Unknown waited his hour.



Section I - 132: cosmos flowed in her


07.07_132:001 - But now she sat by sleeping Satyavan / Awake within, and the enormous Night / Surrounded her with the Unknowable’s vast.

07.07_132:002 - A voice began to speak from her own heart / That was not hers, yet mastered thought and sense.

07.07_132:003 - As it spoke all changed within her and without; / All was, all lived; she felt all being one; / The world of unreality ceased to be: / There was no more a universe built by mind, / Convicted as a structure or a sign; / A spirit, a being saw created things / And cast itself into unnumbered forms / And was what it saw and made; all now became / An evidence of one stupendous truth, / A Truth in which negation had no place, / A being and a living consciousness, / A stark and absolute Reality.

07.07_132:004 - There the unreal could not find a place, / The sense of unreality was slain: / There all was conscious, made of the Infinite, / All had a substance of Eternity.

07.07_132:005 - Yet this was the same Indecipherable; / It seemed to cast from it universe like a dream / Vanishing for ever into an original Void.

07.07_132:006 - But this was no more some vague ubiquitous point / Or a cipher of vastness in unreal Nought.

07.07_132:007 - It was the same but now no more seemed far / To the living clasp of her recovered soul.

07.07_132:008 - It was her self, it was the self of all, / It was the reality of existing things, / It was the consciousness of all that lived / And felt and saw; it was Timelessness and Time, / It was the Bliss of formlessness and form.

07.07_132:009 - It was all Love and the one Beloved’s arms, / It was sight and thought in one all-seeing Mind, / It was joy of being on the peaks of God.

07.07_132:010 - She passed beyond Time into eternity, / Slipped out of space and became the Infinite; / Her being rose into unreachable heights / And found no end of its journey in the Self.

07.07_132:011 - It plunged into the unfathomable deeps / And found no end to the silent mystery / That held all world within one lonely breast, / Yet harboured all creation’s multitudes.

07.07_132:012 - She was all vastness and one measureless point, / She was a height beyond heights, a depth beyond depths, / She lived in the everlasting and was all / That harbours death and bears the wheeling hours.

07.07_132:013 - All contraries were true in one huge spirit / Surpassing measure, change and circumstance.

07.07_132:014 - An individual, one with cosmic self / In the heart of the Transcendent’s miracle / And the secret of World-personality / Was the creator and the lord of all.

07.07_132:015 - Mind was a single innumerable look / Upon himself and all that he became, / Life was his drama and the Vast a stage, / The universe was his body, God its soul.

07.07_132:016 - All was one single immense reality, / All its innumerable phenomenon.

07.07_132:017 - Her spirit saw the world as living God; / It saw the One and knew that all was He.

07.07_132:018 - She knew him as the Absolute’s self-space, / One with her self and ground of all things here / In which the world wanders seeking for the Truth / Guarded behind its face of ignorance: / She followed him through the march of endless Time.

07.07_132:019 - All Nature’s happenings were events in her, / The heart-beats of the cosmos were her own, / All beings thought and felt and moved in her; / She inhabited the vastness of the world, / Its distances were her nature’s boundaries, / Its closenesses her own life’s intimacies.

07.07_132:020 - Her mind became familiar with its mind, / Its body was her body’s larger frame / In which she lived and knew herself in it / One, multitudinous in its multitudes.

07.07_132:021 - She was a single being, yet all things; / The world was her spirit’s wide circumference, / The thoughts of others were her intimates, / Their feelings close to her universal heart, / Their bodies her many bodies kin to her; / She was no more herself but all the world.

07.07_132:022 - Out of the infinitudes all came to her, / Into the infinitudes sentient she spread, / Infinity was her own natural home.

07.07_132:023 - Nowhere she dwelt, her spirit was everywhere, / The distant constellations wheeled round her; / Earth saw her born, all worlds were her colonies, / The greater worlds of life and mind were hers; / All Nature reproduced her in its lines, / Its movements were large copies of her own.

07.07_132:024 - She was the single self of all these selves, / She was in them and they were all in her.

07.07_132:025 - This first was an immense identity / In which her own identity was lost: / What seemed herself was an image of the Whole.

07.07_132:026 - She was a subconscient life of tree and flower, / The outbreak of the honied buds of spring; / She burned in the passion and splendour of the rose, / She was the red heart of the passion flower, / The dream-white of the lotus in its pool.

07.07_132:027 - Out of subconscient life she climbed to mind, / She was thought and the passion of the world’s heart, / She was the godhead hid in the heart of man, / She was the climbing of his soul to God.

07.07_132:028 - The cosmos flowered in her, she was its bed.

07.07_132:029 - She was Time and the dreams of God in Time; / She was Space and the wideness of his days.

07.07_132:030 - From this she rose where Time and Space were not; / The superconscient was her native air, / Infinity was her movement’s natural space; / Eternity looked out from her on Time.


Canto Book8 - 8: THE BOOK OF DEATH

Canto 3 - 8.3: Death in the Forest

Section I - 133: Savitri, Savitri, O Savitri


08.03_133:001 - Now it was here in this great golden dawn / By her still sleeping husband lain she gazed / Into her past as one about to die / Looks back upon the sunlit fields of life / Where he too ran and sported with the rest, / Lifting his head above the huge dark stream / Into whose depths he must for ever plunge.

08.03_133:002 - All she had been and done she lived again.

08.03_133:003 - The whole year in a swift and eddying race / Of memories swept through her and fled away / Into the irrecoverable past.

08.03_133:004 - Then silently she rose and, service done, / Bowed down to the great goddess simply carved / By Satyavan upon a forest stone.

08.03_133:005 - What prayer she breathed her soul and Doorga knew.

08.03_133:006 - Perhaps she felt in the dim forest huge / The infinite Mother watching over her child, / Perhaps the shrouded Voice spoke some still word.

08.03_133:007 - At last she came to the pale mother queen.

08.03_133:008 - She spoke but with guarded lips and tranquil face / As some stray word or some betraying look / Should let pass into the mother’s unknowing breast / Slaying all happiness and need to live / A dire foreknowledge of the grief to come.

08.03_133:009 - Only the needed utterance passage found: / All else she pressed back into her anguished heart / And forced upon her speech an outward peace: / “One year that I have lived with Satyavan / Here on the emerald edge of the vast woods, / In the iron ring of the enormous peaks / Under the blue rifts of the forest sky, / I have not gone into the silences / Of this great woodland that enringed my thoughts / With mystery, nor in its green miracles / Wandered, but this small clearing was my world.

08.03_133:010 - Now has a strong desire seized all my heart / To go with Satyavan holding his hand / Into the life that he has loved and touch / Herbs he has trod and know the forest flowers / And hear at ease the birds and the scurrying life / That starts and ceases, rich far rustle of boughs / And all the mystic whispering of the woods.

08.03_133:011 - Release me now and let my heart have rest.”

08.03_133:012 - She answered: “Do as thy wise mind desires, / O calm child-sovereign with the eyes that rule.

08.03_133:013 - I hold thee for a strong goddess who has come / Pitying our barren days; so dost thou serve / Even as a slave might, yet art thou beyond / All that thou doest, all our minds conceive, / Like the strong sun that serves earth from above.”

08.03_133:014 - Then the doomed husband and the woman who knew / Went with linked hands into that solemn world / Where beauty and grandeur and unspoken dream, / Where Nature’s mystic silence could be felt / Communing with the secrecy of God.

08.03_133:015 - Beside her Satyavan walked full of joy, / Because she moved with him through his green haunts: / He showed her all the forest’s riches, flowers / Innumerable of every odour and hue / And soft thick clinging creepers red and green / And strange rich-plumaged birds, to every cry / That haunted sweetly distant boughs, replied / With the shrill singer’s name more sweetly called.

08.03_133:016 - He spoke of all the things he loved: they were / His boyhood’s comrades and his playfellows, / Coevals and companions of his life / Here in this world whose every mood he knew: / Their thoughts which to the common mind are blank / He shared, to every wild emotion felt / An answer. Deeply she listened, but to hear / The voice that soon would cease from tender words / And treasure its sweet cadences beloved / For lonely memory when none by her walked / And the beloved voice could speak no more.

08.03_133:017 - But little dwelt her mind upon their sense; / Of death, not life she thought or life’s lone end.

08.03_133:018 - Love in her bosom hurt with jagged edges / Of anguish moaned at every step with pain / Crying, “Now, now perhaps his voice will cease / For ever." Even by some vague touch oppressed, / Sometimes her eyes looked round as if their orbs / Might see the dim and dreadful god’s approach.

08.03_133:019 - But Satyavan had paused. He meant to finish / His labour here that happy, linked, uncaring / They two might wander free in the green deep / Primeval mystery of the forest’s heart.

08.03_133:020 - Wordless but near she watched, no turn to lose / Of the bright face and body which she loved.

08.03_133:021 - Her life was now in seconds, not in hours, / And every moment she economised / Like a pale merchant leaned above his store, / The miser of his poor remaining gold.

08.03_133:022 - But Satyavan wielded a joyous axe.

08.03_133:023 - He sang high snatches of a sage’s chant / That pealed of conquered death and demons slain, / And sometimes paused to cry to her sweet speech / Of love and mockery tenderer than love: / She like a pantheress leaped upon his words / And carried them into her cavern heart.

08.03_133:024 - But as he worked, his doom upon him came.

08.03_133:025 - The violent and hungry hounds of pain / Travelled through his body biting as they passed / Silently, and all his suffering breath besieged / Strove to rend life’s strong heart-cords and be free.

08.03_133:026 - Then helped, as if a beast had left its prey, / A moment in a wave of rich relief / Reborn to strength and happy ease he stood / Rejoicing and resumed his confident toil / But with less seeing strokes. Now the great Woodsman / Hewed at him and his labour ceased: lifting / His arm he flung away the poignant axe / Far from him like an instrument of pain.

08.03_133:027 - She came to him in silent anguish and clasped, / And he cried to her, “Savitri, a pang / Cleaves through my head and breast as if the axe / Were piercing it and not the living branch.

08.03_133:028 - Such agony rends me as the tree must feel / When it is sundered and must lose its life.

08.03_133:029 - Awhile let me lay my head upon thy lap / And guard me with thy hands from evil fate: / Perhaps because thou touchest, death may pass.”

08.03_133:030 - Then Savitri sat under branches wide, / Cool, green against the sun, not the hurt tree / Which his keen axe had cloven,—that she shunned; / But leaned beneath a fortunate kingly trunk / She guarded him in her bosom and strove to soothe / His anguished brow and body with her hands.

08.03_133:031 - All grief and fear were dead within her now / And a great calm had fallen. The wish to lessen / His suffering, the impulse that opposes pain / Were the one mortal feeling left. It passed: / Griefless and strong she waited like the gods.

08.03_133:032 - But now his sweet familiar hue was changed / Into a tarnished greyness and his eyes / Dimmed over, forsaken of the clear light she loved.

08.03_133:033 - Only the dull and physical mind was left, / Vacant of the bright spirit’s luminous gaze.

08.03_133:034 - But once before it faded wholly back, / He cried out in a clinging last despair, / “Savitri, Savitri, O Savitri, / Lean down, my soul, and kiss me while I die.”

08.03_133:035 - And even as her pallid lips pressed his, / His failed, losing last sweetness of response; / His cheek pressed down her golden arm. She sought / His mouth still with her living mouth, as if / She could persuade his soul back with her kiss; / Then grew aware they were no more alone.

08.03_133:036 - Something had come there conscious, vast and dire.

08.03_133:037 - Near her she felt a silent shade immense / Chilling the noon with darkness for its back.

08.03_133:038 - An awful hush had fallen upon the place: / There was no cry of birds, no voice of beasts.

08.03_133:039 - A terror and an anguish filled the world, / As if annihilation’s mystery / Had taken a sensible form. A cosmic mind / Looked out on all from formidable eyes / Contemning all with his unbearable gaze / And with immortal lips and a vast brow / It saw in its immense destroying thought / All things and beings as a pitiful dream, / Rejecting with calm disdain Nature’s delight, / The wordless meaning of its deep regard / Voicing the unreality of things / And life that would be for ever but never was / And its brief and vain recurrence without cease, / As if from a Silence without form or name / The Shadow of a remote uncaring god / Doomed to his Naught illusory universe, / Cancelling its show of idea and act in Time / And its imitation of eternity.

08.03_133:040 - She knew that visible Death was standing there / And Satyavan had passed from her embrace.

Canto Book9 - 9: THE BOOK OF ETERNAL NIGHT

Canto 1 - 9.1: Towards the Black Void

Section I - 134: came on her a tremendous change


09.01_134:001 - So was she left alone in the huge wood, / Surrounded by a dim unthinking world, / Her husband’s corpse on her forsaken breast.

09.01_134:002 - She measured not her loss with helpless thoughts, / Nor rent with tears the marble seals of pain: / She rose not yet to face the dreadful god.

09.01_134:003 - Over the body she loved her soul leaned out / In a great stillness without stir or voice, / As if her mind had died with Satyavan.

09.01_134:004 - But still the human heart in her beat on.

09.01_134:005 - Aware still of his being near to hers, / Closely she clasped to her the mute lifeless form / As though to guard the oneness they had been / And keep the spirit still within the frame.

09.01_134:006 - Then suddenly there came on her the change / Which in tremendous moments of our lives / Can overtake sometimes the human soul / And hold it up towards its luminous source.

09.01_134:007 - The veil is torn, the thinker is no more: / Only the spirit sees and all is known.

09.01_134:008 - Then a calm Power seated above our brows / Is seen, unshaken by our thoughts and deeds, / Its stillness bears the voices of the world: / Immobile, it moves Nature, looks on life.

09.01_134:009 - It shapes immutably its far-seen ends; / Untouched and tranquil amid error and tears / And measureless above our striving wills, / Its gaze controls the turbulent whirl of things.

09.01_134:010 - To mate with the Glory it sees, the spirit grows: / The voice of life is tuned to infinite sounds, / The moments on great wings of lightning come / And godlike thoughts surprise the mind of earth.

09.01_134:011 - Into the soul’s splendour and intensity / A crescent of miraculous birth is tossed, / Whose horn of mystery floats in a bright void / As into a heaven of strength and silence, thought / Is ravished; all this living mortal clay / Is seized and in a swift and fiery flood / Of touches shaped by a Harmonist unseen.

09.01_134:012 - A new sight comes, new voices in us form / A body of the music of the gods.

09.01_134:013 - Immortal yearnings without name leap down, / Large quiverings of godhead seeking run / And weave upon a puissant field of calm / A high and lonely ecstasy of will.

09.01_134:014 - This in a moment’s depths was born in her.

09.01_134:015 - Now to the limitless gaze disclosed that sees / Things barred from human thinking’s earthly lids, / The Spirit who had hidden in nature soared / Out of his luminous nest within the worlds.

09.01_134:016 - Like a vast fire it climbed the skies of night.

09.01_134:017 - Thus were the cords of self-oblivion torn.

09.01_134:018 - Like one who looks up to far heights she saw, / Ancient and strong as on a windless summit / Above her where she had worked in her lone mind / Labouring apart in a sole tower of self, / The source of all which she had seemed or wrought, / A power projected into cosmic space, / A slow embodiment of the aeonic will, / A starry fragment of the eternal Truth, / The passionate instrument of an unmoved Power.

09.01_134:019 - A Presence was there that filled the listening world, / A central All assumed her boundless life.

09.01_134:020 - A sovereignty, a silence and a swiftness, / One brooded over abysses who was she.

09.01_134:021 - As in a choric robe of unheard sounds / A force descended trailing endless lights; / Linking Time’s seconds to Infinity, / Illimitably it girt the earth and her: / It sank into her soul and she was changed.

09.01_134:022 - Then like a thought fulfilled by some great word / That mightiness assumed a symbol form; / Her being’s spaces quivered with its touch, / It covered her as with immortal wings; / On its lips the curve of the unuttered Truth, / A halo of Wisdom’s lightnings for its crown, / It entered the mystic lotus in her head, / A thousand-petalled home of power and light.

09.01_134:023 - Immortal leader of her mortality, / Doer of her works and fountain of her words, / Invulnerable by Time, omnipotent, / It stood above her calm, immobile, mute.


Section I - 135: planting her feet where his had trod


09.01_135:001 - All in her mated with that mighty hour, / As if the last remnant had been slain by Death / Of the humanity that once was hers.

09.01_135:002 - Assuming a spiritual wide control, / Making life’s sea a mirror of heaven’s sky, / The young divinity in her earthly limbs / Filled with celestial strength her mortal part.

09.01_135:003 - Over was the haunted pain, the rending fear: / Her grief had passed away, her mind was still, / Her heart beat quietly with a sovereign force.

09.01_135:004 - There came a freedom from the heart-strings’ clutch, / Now all her acts sprang from a godhead’s calm.

09.01_135:005 - Calmly she laid upon the forest soil / The dead who still reposed upon her breast / And bore to turn away from the dead form: / Sole now she rose to meet the dreadful god.

09.01_135:006 - That mightier spirit turned its mastering gaze / On life and things, inheritor of a work / Left to it unfinished from her halting past, / When yet the mind, a passionate learner, toiled / And ill-shaped instruments were crudely moved.

09.01_135:007 - Transcended now was the poor human rule; / A sovereign power was there, a godlike will.

09.01_135:008 - A moment yet she lingered motionless / And looked down on the dead man at her feet; / Then like a tree recovering from a wind / She raised her noble head; fronting her gaze / Something stood there, unearthly, sombre, grand, / A limitless denial of all being / That wore the terror and wonder of a shape.

09.01_135:009 - In its appalling eyes the tenebrous Form / Bore the deep pity of destroying gods.

09.01_135:010 - A sorrowful irony curved the dreadful lips / That speak the word of doom. Eternal Night, / In the dire beauty of an immortal face, / Pitying arose, receiving all that lives / For ever into its fathomless heart, refuge / Of creatures from their anguish and world-pain.

09.01_135:011 - His shape was nothingness made real, his limbs / Were monuments of transience and beneath / Brows of unwearying calm large godlike lids / Silent beheld the writhing serpent, life.

09.01_135:012 - Unmoved their timeless wide unchanging gaze / Had seen the unprofitable cycles pass, / Survived the passing of unnumbered stars / And sheltered still the same immutable orbs.

09.01_135:013 - The two opposed each other with their eyes, / Woman and universal god: around her, / Piling their void unbearable loneliness / Upon her mighty uncompanioned soul, / Many inhuman solitudes came close.

09.01_135:014 - Vacant eternities forbidding hope / Laid upon her their huge and lifeless look, / And to her ears silencing earthly sounds, / A sad and formidable voice arose / Which seemed the whole adverse world’s. “Unclasp”, it cried, / “Thy passionate influence and relax, O slave / Of Nature, changing tool of changeless Law, / Who vainly writhst rebellion to my yoke, / Thy elemental grasp; weep and forget.

09.01_135:015 - Entomb thy passion in its living grave.

09.01_135:016 - Leave now the once-loved spirit’s abandoned robe: / Pass lonely back to thy vain life on earth.”

09.01_135:017 - It ceased, she moved not and it spoke again, / Lowering its mighty key to human chords,— / Yet a dread cry behind the uttered sounds, / Echoing all sadness and immortal scorn, / Moaned like a hunger of far wandering waves.

09.01_135:018 - “Wilt thou for ever keep thy passionate hold, / Thyself, a creature doomed like him to pass, / Denying his soul death’s calm and silent rest?

09.01_135:019 - Relax thy grasp; this body is earth’s and thine, / His spirit now belongs to a greater power.

09.01_135:020 - Woman, thy husband suffers.” Savitri / Drew back her heart’s force that clasped his body still / Where from her lap renounced on the smooth grass / Softly it lay, as often before in sleep / When from their couch she rose in the white dawn / Called by her daily tasks: now too as if called / She rose and stood gathered in lonely strength, / Like one who drops his mantle for a race / And waits the signal, motionlessly swift.

09.01_135:021 - She knew not to what course: her spirit above / On the crypt-summit of her secret form / Like one left sentinel on a mountain crest.

09.01_135:022 - A fiery-footed splendour puissant-winged / Watched flaming-silent with her voiceless soul / Like a still sail upon a windless sea.

09.01_135:023 - White passionless it rode, an anchored might, / Waiting what far-ridged impulse should arise / Out of the eternal depths and cast its surge.

09.01_135:024 - Then Death, the king, leaned boundless down, as leans / Night over tired lands when evening pales / And fading gleams break down the horizon’s walls, / Nor yet the dusk grows mystic with the moon.

09.01_135:025 - The dim and awful godhead rose erect / From his brief stooping to his touch on earth, / And like a dream that wakes out of a dream, / Forsaking the poor mould of that dead clay, / Another luminous Satyavan arose, / Starting upright from the recumbent earth / As if someone over viewless borders stepped / Emerging on the edge of unseen worlds.

09.01_135:026 - In the earth’s day the silent marvel stood / Between the mortal woman and the god.

09.01_135:027 - Such seemed he as if one departed came / Wearing the light of a celestial shape / Splendidly alien to the mortal air.

09.01_135:028 - The mind sought things long loved and fell back foiled / From unfamiliar hues, beheld yet longed, / By the sweet radiant form unsatisfied, / Incredulous of its too bright hints of heaven; / Too strange the brilliant phantasm to life’s clasp / Desiring the warm creations of the earth / Reared in the ardour of material suns, / The senses seized in vain a glorious shade: / Only the spirit knew the spirit still, / And the heart divined the old loved heart, though changed.

09.01_135:029 - Between two realms he stood, not wavering, / But fixed in quiet strong expectancy, / Like one who, sightless, listens for a command.

09.01_135:030 - So were they immobile on that earthly field, / Powers not of earth, though one in human clay.

09.01_135:031 - On either side of one two spirits strove; / Silence battled with silence, vast with vast.

09.01_135:032 - But now the impulse of the Path was felt / Moving from the Silence that supports the stars / To touch the confines of the visible world.

09.01_135:033 - Luminous he moved away; behind him Death / Went slowly with his noiseless tread, as seen / In dream-built fields a shadowy herdsman glides / Behind some wanderer from his voiceless herds, / And Savitri moved behind eternal Death, / Her mortal pace was equalled with the god’s.

09.01_135:034 - Wordless she travelled in her lover’s steps, / Planting her human feet where his had trod, / Into the perilous silences beyond.


Section I - 136: aim, joy, origin, Satyavan


09.01_136:001 - At first in a blind stress of woods she moved / With strange inhuman paces on the soil, / Journeying as if upon an unseen road.

09.01_136:002 - Around her on the green and imaged earth / The flickering screen of forests ringed her steps.

09.01_136:003 - Its thick luxurious obstacle of boughs / Besieged her body pressing dimly through / In a rich realm of whispers palpable, / And all the murmurous beauty of the leaves / Rippled around her like an emerald robe.

09.01_136:004 - But more and more this grew an alien sound, / And her old intimate body seemed to her / A burden which her being remotely bore.

09.01_136:005 - Herself lived far in some uplifted scene / Where to the trance-chained vision of pursuit, / Sole presences in a high spaceless dream, / The luminous spirit glided stilly on / And the great shadow travelled vague behind.

09.01_136:006 - Still with an amorous crowd of seeking hands / Softly entreated by their old desires / Her senses felt earth’s close and gentle air / Cling round them and in troubled branches knew / Uncertain treadings of a faint-foot wind: / She bore dim fragrances, far callings touched; / The wild bird’s voice and its winged rustle came / As if a sigh from some forgotten world.

09.01_136:007 - Earth stood aloof, yet near: round her it wove / Its sweetness and its greenness and delight, / Its brilliance suave of well-loved vivid hues, / Sunlight arriving to its golden noon, / And the blue heavens and the caressing soil.

09.01_136:008 - The ancient Mother offered to her child / Her simple world of kind familiar things.

09.01_136:009 - But now as if the body’s sensuous hold / Curbing the godhead of her infinite walk / Had freed those spirits to their grander road / Across some boundary’s intangible bar, / The silent god grew mighty and remote / In other spaces and the soul she loved / Lost its consenting nearness to her life.

09.01_136:010 - Into a deep and unfamiliar air / Enormous, windless, without stir or sound / They seemed to enlarge away, drawn by some wide / Pale distance, from the warm control of earth / And her grown far. Now, now they would escape.

09.01_136:011 - Then flaming from her body’s nest, alarmed, / Her violent spirit soared at Satyavan.

09.01_136:012 - Out mid the plunge of heaven-surrounded rocks / So in a terror and a wrath divine / From her eyrie streams against the ascending death, / Indignant at its crouching point of steel, / A fierce she-eagle threatened in her brood, / Borne on a rush of puissance and a cry, / Outwinging like a mass of golden fire.

09.01_136:013 - So on a spirit’s flaming outrush borne / She crossed the borders of dividing sense; / Like pale discarded sheaths dropped dully down / Her mortal members fell back from her soul.

09.01_136:014 - A moment of a secret body’s sleep, / Her trance knew not of sun or earth or world; / Thought, time and death were absent from her grasp: / She knew not self, forgotten was Savitri.

09.01_136:015 - All was the violent ocean of a will / Where lived captive to an immense caress, / Possessed in a supreme identity, / Her aim, joy, origin, Satyavan alone.

09.01_136:016 - Her sovereign prisoned in her being’s core, / He beat there like a rhythmic heart,—herself / But different still, one loved, enveloped, clasped, / A treasure saved from the collapse of space.

09.01_136:017 - Around him nameless, infinite she surged, / Her spirit fulfilled in his spirit, rich with all Time, / As if Love’s deathless moment had been found, / A pearl within eternity’s white shell.

09.01_136:018 - Then out of the engulfing sea of trance / Her mind rose drenched to light streaming with hues / Of vision and, awake once more to Time, / Returned to shape the lineaments of things / And live in borders of the seen and known.

09.01_136:019 - Onward the three still moved in her soul-scene.

09.01_136:020 - As if pacing through fragments of a dream, / She seemed to travel on, a visioned shape, / Imagining other musers like herself, / By them imagined in their lonely sleep.

09.01_136:021 - Ungrasped, unreal, yet familiar, old, / Like clefts of unsubstantial memory, / Scenes often traversed, never lived in, fled / Past her unheeding to forgotten goals.

09.01_136:022 - In voiceless regions they were travellers / Alone in a new world where souls were not, / But only living moods. A strange, hushed, weird / Country was round them, strange far skies above, / A doubting space where dreaming objects lived / Within themselves their own unchanged idea.

09.01_136:023 - Weird were the grasses, weird the treeless plains, / Weird ran the road which like fear hastening / Towards that of which it has most terror, passed / Phantasmal between pillared conscious rocks / Sombre and high, gates brooding, whose stone thoughts / Lost their huge sense beyond in giant night.

09.01_136:024 - Enigma of the Inconscient’s sculptural sleep, / Symbols of the approach to darkness old / And monuments of her titanic reign, / Opening to depths like dumb appalling jaws / That wait a traveller down a haunted path / Attracted to a mystery that slays, / They watched across her road, cruel and still; / Sentinels they stood of dumb Necessity, / Mute heads of vigilant and sullen gloom, / Carved muzzle of a dim enormous world.

09.01_136:025 - Then to that chill sere heavy line arrived / Where his feet touched the shadowy marches’ brink, / Turning arrested luminous Satyavan / Looked back with his wonderful eyes at Savitri.

09.01_136:026 - But Death pealed forth his vast abysmal cry: / “O mortal, turn back to thy transient kind; / Aspire not to accompany Death to his home, / As if thy breath could live where Time must die.

09.01_136:027 - Think not thy mind-born passion strength from heaven / To uplift thy spirit from its earthly base / And, breaking out from the material cage, / To upbuoy thy feet of dream in groundless Nought / And bear thee through the pathless infinite.

09.01_136:028 - Only in human limits man lives safe.

09.01_136:029 - Trust not in the unreal Lords of Time, / Immortal deeming this image of thyself / Which they have built on a dream’s floating ground.

09.01_136:030 - Let not the dreadful goddess move thy soul / To enlarge thy vehement trespass into worlds / Where it shall perish like a helpless thought.

09.01_136:031 - Know the cold term-stones of thy hopes in life.

09.01_136:032 - Armed vainly with the Idea’s borrowed might / Dare not to outstep man’s bound and measured force.

09.01_136:033 - Ignorant and stumbling, in brief boundaries pent, / He crowns himself the world’s mock sovereign / Tormenting Nature with the works of Mind.

09.01_136:034 - O sleeper dreaming of divinity, / Wake trembling mid the indifferent silences / In which thy few weak chords of being die.

09.01_136:035 - Impermanent creatures, sorrowful foam of Time, / Your transient loves bind not the eternal gods."

09.01_136:036 - The dread voice ebbed in the consenting hush / Which seemed to close upon it, wide, intense, / A wordless sanction from the jaws of Night.

09.01_136:037 - The Woman answered not. Her high nude soul, / Stripped of the girdle of mortality, / Against fixed destiny and the grooves of law / Stood up in its sheer will a primal force.

09.01_136:038 - Still like a statue on its pedestal, / Lone in the silence and to vastness bared, / Against midnight’s dumb abysses piled in front / A columned shaft of fire and light she rose.



Section I - 137: O death who reasonest, I reason not


09.02_137:001 - Awhile on the chill dreadful edge of Night / All stood as if a world were doomed to die / And waited on the eternal silence’ brink.

09.02_137:002 - Heaven leaned towards them like a cloudy brow / Of menace through the dim and voiceless hush.

09.02_137:003 - As thoughts stand mute on a despairing verge / Where the last depths plunge into nothingness / And the last dreams must end, they paused; in their front / Were glooms like shadowy wings, behind them pale / The lifeless evening was a dead man’s gaze.

09.02_137:004 - Hungry beyond, the night desired her soul.

09.02_137:005 - But still in its lone niche of templed strength / Motionless, her flame-bright spirit, mute, erect, / Burned like a torch-fire from a windowed room / Pointing against the darkness’ sombre breast.

09.02_137:006 - The Woman first affronted the Abyss / Daring to journey through the eternal Night.

09.02_137:007 - Armoured with light she advanced her foot to plunge / Into the dread and hueless vacancy; / Immortal, unappalled her spirit faced / The danger of the ruthless eyeless waste.

09.02_137:008 - Against night’s inky ground they stirred, moulding / Mysterious motion on her human tread, / A swimming action and a drifting march / Like figures moving before eyelids closed: / All as in dreams went slipping, gliding on.

09.02_137:009 - The rock-gate’s heavy walls were left behind; / As if through passages of receding time / The present and past into the Timeless lapsed; / Arrested upon dim adventure’s brink, / The future ended drowned in nothingness.

09.02_137:010 - Amid collapsing shapes they wound obscure; / The fading vestibules of a tenebrous world / Received them, where they seemed to move and yet / Be still, nowhere advancing yet to pass, / A dumb procession a dim picture bounds, / Not conscious forms threading a real scene.

09.02_137:011 - A mystery of terror’s boundlessness, / Gathering its hungry strength the huge pitiless void / Surrounded slowly with its soundless depths, / And monstrous, cavernous, a shapeless throat / Devoured her into its shadowy strangling mass, / The fierce spiritual agony of a dream.

09.02_137:012 - A curtain of impenetrable dread, / The darkness hung around her cage of sense / As when the trees have turned to blotted shades / And the last friendly glimmer fades away, / Around a bullock in the forest tied / By hunters closes in no empty night.

09.02_137:013 - The thought that strives in the world was here unmade; / Its effort it renounced to live and know, / Convinced at last that it had never been; / It perished, all its dream of action done: / This clotted cypher was its dark result.

09.02_137:014 - In the smothering stress of this stupendous Nought / Mind could not think, breath could not breathe, the soul / Could not remember or feel itself; it seemed / A hollow gulf of sterile emptiness, / A zero oblivious of the sum it closed, / An abnegation of the Maker’s joy / Saved by no wide repose, no depth of peace.

09.02_137:015 - On all that claims here to be Truth and God / And conscious self and the revealing Word / And the creative rapture of the Mind / And Love and Knowledge and heart’s delight, there fell / The immense refusal of the eternal No.

09.02_137:016 - As disappears a golden lamp in gloom / Borne into distance from the eye’s desire, / Into the shadows vanished Savitri.

09.02_137:017 - There was no course, no path, no end or goal: / Visionless she moved amid insensible gulfs, / Or drove through some great black unknowing Waste / Or whirled in a dumb eddy of meeting winds / Assembled by the titan hands of Chance.

09.02_137:018 - There was none with her in the dreadful Vast: / She saw no more the vague tremendous god, / Her eyes had lost their luminous Satyavan.

09.02_137:019 - Yet not for this her spirit failed, but held / More deeply than the bounded senses can / Which grasp externally and find to lose / Its object loved. So when on earth they lived / She had felt him straying through the glades, the glades / A scene in her, its clefts her being’s vistas / Opening their secrets to his search and joy, / Because to jealous sweetness in her heart / Whatever happy space his cherished feet / Preferred, must be at once her soul embracing / His body, passioning dumbly to his tread.

09.02_137:020 - But now a silent gulf between them came / And to abysmal loneliness she fell, / Even from herself cast out, from love remote.

09.02_137:021 - Long hours, since long it seems when sluggish time / Is measured by the throbs of the soul’s pain, / In an unreal darkness empty and drear / She travelled treading on the corpse of life, / Lost in a blindness of extinguished souls.

09.02_137:022 - Solitary in the anguish of the void / She lived in spite of death, she conquered still; / In vain her puissant being was oppressed: / Her heavy long monotony of pain / Tardily of its fierce self-torture tired.

09.02_137:023 - At first a faint inextinguishable gleam, / Pale but immortal, flickered in the gloom / As if a memory came to spirits dead, / A memory that wished to live again, / Dissolved from mind in Nature’s natal sleep.

09.02_137:024 - It wandered like a lost ray of the moon / Revealing to the night her soul of dread; / Serpentine in the gleam the darkness lolled, / Its black hoods jewelled with the mystic glow; / Its dull sleek folds shrank back and coiled and slid, / As though they felt all light a cruel pain / And suffered from the pale approach of hope.

09.02_137:025 - Night felt assailed her heavy sombre reign; / The splendour of some bright eternity / Threatened with this faint beam of wandering Truth / Her empire of the everlasting Nought.

09.02_137:026 - Implacable in her intolerant strength / And confident that she alone was true, / She strove to stifle the frail dangerous ray; / Aware of an all-negating immensity / She reared her giant head of Nothingness, / Her mouth of darkness swallowing all that is; / She saw in herself the tenebrous Absolute.

09.02_137:027 - But still the light prevailed and still it grew, / And Savitri to her lost self awoke; / Her limbs refused the cold embrace of death, / Her heart-beats triumphed in the grasp of pain; / Her soul persisted claiming for its joy / The soul of the beloved now seen no more.

09.02_137:028 - Before her in the stillness of the world / Once more she heard the treading of a god, / And out of the dumb darkness Satyavan, / Her husband, grew into a luminous shade.

09.02_137:029 - Then a sound pealed through that dead monstrous realm: / Vast like the surge in a tired swimmer’s ears, / Clamouring, a fatal iron-hearted roar, / Death missioned to the night his lethal call.

09.02_137:030 - “This is my silent dark immensity, / This is the home of everlasting Night, / This is the secrecy of Nothingness / Entombing the vanity of life’s desires.

09.02_137:031 - Hast thou beheld thy source, O transient heart, / And known from what the dream thou art was made?

09.02_137:032 - In this stark sincerity of nude emptiness / Hopest thou still always to last and love?"

09.02_137:033 - The Woman answered not. Her spirit refused / The voice of the Night that knew and Death that thought.

09.02_137:034 - In her beginningless infinity / Through her soul’s reaches unconfined she gazed; / She saw the undying fountains of her life, / She knew herself eternal without birth.

09.02_137:035 - But still opposing her with endless night / Death, the dire god, inflicted on her eyes / The immortal calm of his tremendous gaze: / “Although thou hast survived the unborn void / Which never shall forgive, while Time endures, / The primal violence that fashioned thought, / Forcing the immobile Vast to suffer and live / This sorrowful victory only hast thou won / To live for a little without Satyavan.

09.02_137:036 - What shall the ancient goddess give to thee / Who helps thy heart-beats? Only she prolongs / The nothing dreamed existence and delays / With the labour of living thy eternal sleep.

09.02_137:037 - A fragile miracle of thinking clay, / Armed with illusions walks the child of Time.

09.02_137:038 - To fill the void around he feels and dreads, / The void he came from and to which he goes, / He magnifies his self and names it God.

09.02_137:039 - He calls the heavens to help his suffering hopes.

09.02_137:040 - He sees above him with a longing heart / Bare spaces more unconscious than himself / That have not even his privilege of mind / And empty of all but their unreal blue / And peoples them with bright and merciful powers.

09.02_137:041 - For the sea roars around him and earth quakes / Beneath his steps, and fire is at his doors, / And death prowls baying through the woods of life.

09.02_137:042 - Moved by the Presences with which he yearns, / He offers in implacable shrines his soul / And clothes all with the beauty of his dreams.

09.02_137:043 - The gods who watch the earth with sleepless eyes / And guide its giant stumblings through the void, / Have given to man the burden of his mind; / In his unwilling heart they have lit their fires / And sown in it incurable unrest.

09.02_137:044 - His mind is a hunter upon tracks unknown; / Amusing Time with vain discovery, / He deepens with thought the mystery of his fate / And turns to song his laughter and his tears.

09.02_137:045 - His mortality vexing with the immortal’s dreams, / Troubling his transience with the infinite’s breath / They gave him hungers which no food can fill; / He is the cattle of the shepherd gods.

09.02_137:046 - His body the tether with which he is tied, / They cast for fodder grief and hope and joy: / His pasture ground they have fenced with Ignorance.

09.02_137:047 - Into his fragile undefended breast / They have breathed a courage that is met by death, / They have given a wisdom that is mocked by night, / They have traced a journey that foresees no goal.

09.02_137:048 - Aimless man toils in an uncertain world / Lulled by inconstant pauses of his pain, / Scourged like a beast by the infinite desire, / Bound to the chariot of the dreadful gods.

09.02_137:049 - But if thou still canst hope and still wouldst love, / Return to thy body’s shell they tie to earth, / And with thy heart’s little remnants try to live.

09.02_137:050 - Hope not to win back to thee Satyavan.

09.02_137:051 - Yet since thy strength deserves no trivial crown, / Gifts I can give to soothe thy wounded life.

09.02_137:052 - The pacts which transient beings make with fate, / And the wayside sweetness earth-bound hearts would pluck, / These if thy will accepts make freely thine.

09.02_137:053 - Choose a life’s hopes for thy deceiving prize."

09.02_137:054 - As ceased the ruthless and tremendous Voice, / Unendingly there rose in Savitri / Like moonlit ridges on a shuddering flood / A stir of thoughts out of some silence born / Across the sea of her dumb fathomless heart.

09.02_137:055 - At last she spoke; her voice was heard by Night: / “I bow not to thee, O huge mask of Death, / Black lie of night to the cowed soul of man, / Unreal, inescapable end of things, / Thou grim jest played with the immortal spirit.

09.02_137:056 - Conscious of immortality I walk.

09.02_137:057 - A victor spirit conscious of my force, / Not as a suppliant to thy gates I came: / Unslain I have survived the clutch of Night.

09.02_137:058 - My first strong grief moves not my seated mind; / My unwept tears have turned to pearls of strength: / I have transformed my ill-shaped brittle clay / Into the hardness of a statued soul.

09.02_137:059 - Now in the wrestling of the splendid gods / My spirit shall be obstinate and strong / Against the vast refusals of the world.

09.02_137:060 - I stoop not with the subject mob of minds / Who run to glean with eager satisfied hands / And pick from its mire mid many trampling feet / Its scornful small concessions to the weak.

09.02_137:061 - Mine is the labour of the battling gods: / Imposing on the slow reluctant years / The flaming will that reigns beyond the stars, / They lay the law of Mind on Matter’s works / And win the soul’s wish from earth’s inconscient force.

09.02_137:062 - First I demand whatever Satyavan, / My husband, waking in the forest’s charm / Out of his long pure childhood’s lonely dreams, / Desired and had not for his beautiful life.

09.02_137:063 - Give, if thou must, or if thou canst, refuse."

09.02_137:064 - Death bowed his head in scornful cold assent, / The builder of this dreamlike earth for man / Who has mocked with vanity all gifts he gave.

09.02_137:065 - Uplifting his disastrous voice he spoke: / “Indulgent to the dreams my touch shall break, / I yield to his blind father’s longing heart / Kingdom and power and friends and greatness lost / And royal trappings for his peaceful age, / The pallid pomps of man’s declining days, / The silvered decadent glories of life’s fall.

09.02_137:066 - To one who wiser grew by adverse fate, / Goods I restore the deluded soul prefers / To impersonal nothingness’s bare sublime.

09.02_137:067 - The sensuous solace of the light I give / To eyes which could have found a larger realm, / A deeper vision in their fathomless night.

09.02_137:068 - For that this man desired and asked in vain / While still he lived on earth and cherished hope.

09.02_137:069 - Back from the grandeur of my perilous realms / Go, mortal, to thy small permitted sphere!

09.02_137:070 - Hasten swift-footed, lest to slay thy life / The great laws thou hast violated, moved, / Open at last on thee their marble eyes."

09.02_137:071 - But Savitri answered the disdainful Shade: / “World-spirit, I was thy equal spirit born.

09.02_137:072 - I am immortal in my mortality.

09.02_137:073 - I tremble not before the immobile gaze / Of the unchanging marble hierarchies / That look with the stone eyes of Law and Fate.

09.02_137:074 - My soul can meet them with its living fire.

09.02_137:075 - Out of thy shadow give me back again / Into earth’s flowering spaces Satyavan / In the sweet transiency of human limbs / To do with him my spirit’s burning will.

09.02_137:076 - I will bear with him the ancient Mother’s load, / I will follow with him earth’s path that leads to God.

09.02_137:077 - Else shall the eternal spaces open to me / While round us strange horizons far recede, / Travelling together the immense unknown.

09.02_137:078 - For I who have trod with him the tracts of Time, / Can meet behind his steps whatever night / Or unimaginable stupendous dawn / Breaks on our spirits in the untrod Beyond.

09.02_137:079 - Wherever thou leadst his soul I shall pursue."

09.02_137:080 - But to her claim opposed, implacable, / Insisting on the immutable Decree, / Insisting on the immitigable Law / And the insignificance of created things, / Out of the rolling wastes of night there came / Born from the enigma of the unknowable depths / A voice of majesty and appalling scorn.

09.02_137:081 - As when the storm-haired Titan-striding sea / Throws on a swimmer its tremendous laugh / Remembering all the joy its waves had drowned, / So from the darkness of the sovereign night / Against the Woman’s boundless heart arose / The almighty cry of universal Death: / “Hast thou god-wings or feet that tread my stars, / Frail creature with the courage that aspires, / Forgetting thy bounds of thought, thy mortal role?

09.02_137:082 - Their orbs were coiled before thy soul was formed.

09.02_137:083 - I, Death, created them out of my void; / All things I have built in them and I destroy.

09.02_137:084 - I made the worlds my net, each joy a mesh.

09.02_137:085 - A Hunger amorous of its suffering prey, / Life that devours, my image see in things.

09.02_137:086 - Mortal, whose spirit is my wandering breath, / Whose transience was imagined by my smile, / Flee clutching thy poor gains to thy trembling breast / Pierced by my pangs Time shall not soon appease.

09.02_137:087 - Blind slave of my deaf force whom I compel / To sin that I may punish, to desire / That I may scourge thee with despair and grief / And thou come bleeding to me at the last, / Thy nothingness recognised, my greatness known, / Turn nor attempt forbidden happy fields / Meant for the souls that can obey my law, / Lest in their sombre shrines thy tread awake / From their uneasy iron-hearted sleep / The Furies who avenge fulfilled desire.

09.02_137:088 - Dread lest in skies where passion hoped to live, / The Unknown’s lightnings start and terrified, / Lone, sobbing, hunted by the hounds of heaven, / A wounded and forsaken soul, thou flee / Through the long torture of the centuries, / Nor many lives exhaust the tireless Wrath / Hell cannot slake nor heaven’s mercy assuage.

09.02_137:089 - I will take from thee the black eternal grip: / Clasping in thy heart thy fate’s exiguous doles / Depart in peace, if peace for man is just."

09.02_137:090 - But Savitri answered meeting scorn with scorn, / The mortal woman to the dreadful Lord: / “Who is this God imagined by thy night, / Contemptuously creating worlds disdained, / Who made for vanity the brilliant stars?

09.02_137:091 - Not he who has reared his temple in my thoughts / And made his sacred floor my human heart.

09.02_137:092 - My God is Will and triumphs in his paths, / My God is Love and sweetly suffers all.

09.02_137:093 - To him I have offered hope for sacrifice / And gave my longings as a sacrament.

09.02_137:094 - Who shall prohibit or hedge in his course, / The wonderful, the charioteer, the swift?

09.02_137:095 - A traveller of the million roads of life, / His steps familiar with the lights of heaven / Tread without pain the sword-paved courts of hell; / There he descends to edge eternal joy.

09.02_137:096 - Love's golden wings have power to fan thy void: / The eyes of love gaze starlike through death's night, / The feet of love tread naked hardest worlds.

09.02_137:097 - He labours in the depths, exults on the heights; / He shall remake thy universe, O Death.

09.02_137:098 - She spoke and for a while no voice replied, / While still they travelled through the trackless night / And still that gleam was like a pallid eye / Troubling the darkness with its doubtful gaze.

09.02_137:099 - Then once more came a deep and perilous pause / In that unreal journey through blind Nought; / Once more a Thought, a Word in the void arose / And Death made answer to the human soul: / What is thy hope? to what dost thou aspire?

09.02_137:100 - This is thy body's sweetest lure of bliss, / Assailed by pain a frail precarious form, / To please for a few years thy faltering sense / With honey of physical longings and the heart's fire / And a vain oneness seeking to embrace / The brilliant idol of a fugitive hour.

09.02_137:101 - And thou, what art thou, soul, thou glorious dream / Of brief emotions made and glittering thoughts, / A thin dance of fireflies speeding through the night, / A sparkling ferment in life's sunlit mire?

09.02_137:102 - Wilt thou claim immortality, O heart, / Crying against the eternal witnesses / That thou and he are endless powers and last?

09.02_137:103 - Death only lasts and the inconscient Void.

09.02_137:104 - I only am eternal and endure.

09.02_137:105 - I am the shapeless formidable Vast, / I am the emptiness that men call Space, / I am a timeless Nothingness carrying all, / I am the Illimitable, the mute Alone.

09.02_137:106 - I, Death, am He; there is no other God.

09.02_137:107 - All from my depths are born, they live by death; / All to my depths return and are no more.

09.02_137:108 - I have made a world by my inconscient Force.

09.02_137:109 - My force is Nature that creates and slays / The hearts that hope, the limbs that long to live.

09.02_137:110 - I have made man her instrument and slave, / His body I made my banquet, his life my food.

09.02_137:111 - Man has no other help but only Death; / He comes to me at his end for rest and peace.

09.02_137:112 - I, Death, am the one refuge of thy soul.

09.02_137:113 - The gods to whom man prays can help not man; / They are my imaginations and my moods / Reflected in him by illusion’s power.

09.02_137:114 - That which thou seest as thy immortal self / Is a shadowy icon of my infinite, / Is Death in thee dreaming of eternity.

09.02_137:115 - I am the Immobile in which all things move, / I am the nude Inane in which they cease: / I have no body and no tongue to speak, / I commune not with human eye and ear; / Only thy thought gave a figure to my void.

09.02_137:116 - Because, O aspirant to divinity, / Thou calledst me to wrestle with thy soul, / I have assumed a face, a form, a voice.

09.02_137:117 - But if there were a being witnessing all, / How should he help thy passionate desire?

09.02_137:118 - Aloof he watches sole and absolute, / Indifferent to thy cry in nameless calm.

09.02_137:119 - His being is pure, unwounded, motionless, one.

09.02_137:120 - One endless watches the inconscient scene / Where all things perish, as the foam the stars.

09.02_137:121 - The One lives for ever. There no Satyavan / Changing was born and there no Savitri / Claims from brief life her bribe of joy. There love / Came never with his fretful eyes of tears, / Nor Time is there nor the vain vasts of Space.

09.02_137:122 - It wears no living face, it has no name, / No gaze, no heart that throbs, it asks no second / To aid its being or to share its joys.

09.02_137:123 - It is delight immortally alone.

09.02_137:124 - If thou desirest immortality, / Be then alone sufficient to thy soul: / Live in thyself; forget the man thou lov’st.

09.02_137:125 - My last grand death shall rescue thee from life; / Then shalt thou rise into thy unnamed source."

09.02_137:126 - But Savitri replied to the dread Voice: / “O Death, who reasonest, I reason not, / Reason that scans and breaks, but cannot build / Or builds in vain because she doubts her work.

09.02_137:127 - I am, I love, I see, I act, I will."

09.02_137:128 - Death answered her, one deep surrounding cry: / “Know also. Knowing, thou shalt cease to love / And cease to will, delivered from thy heart, / So shalt thou rest for ever and be still, / Consenting to the impermanence of things."

09.02_137:129 - But Savitri replied for man to Death: / “When I have loved for ever, I shall know.

09.02_137:130 - Love in me knows the truth all changings mask.

09.02_137:131 - I know that knowledge is a vast embrace: / I know that every being is myself, / In every heart is hidden the myriad One.

09.02_137:132 - I know the calm Transcendent bears the world, / The veiled Inhabitant, the silent Lord: / I feel his secret act, his intimate fire; / I hear the murmur of the cosmic Voice.

09.02_137:133 - I know my coming was a wave from God.

09.02_137:134 - For all his suns were conscient in my birth, / And one who loves in us came veiled by death.

09.02_137:135 - Then man was born among the monstrous stars / Dowered with a mind and heart to conquer thee."

09.02_137:136 - In the eternity of his ruthless will / Sure of his empire and his armoured might, / Like one disdaining violent helpless words / From victim lips Death answered not again.

09.02_137:137 - He stood in silence and in darkness wrapped, / A figure motionless, a shadow vague, / Girt with the terrors of his secret sword.

09.02_137:138 - Half-seen in clouds appeared a sombre face; / Night’s dusk tiara was his matted hair, / The ashes of the pyre his forehead’s sign.

09.02_137:139 - Once more a Wanderer in the unending Night, / Blindly forbidden by dead vacant eyes, / She travelled through the dumb unhoping vasts.

09.02_137:140 - Around her rolled the shuddering waste of gloom, / Its swallowing emptiness and joyless death / Resentful of her thought and life and love.

09.02_137:141 - Through the long fading night by her compelled, / Gliding half-seen on their unearthly path, / Phantasmal in the dimness moved the three.


Canto Book10 - 10: THE BOOK OF THE DOUBLE TWILIGHT

Canto 1 - 10.1: The Dream Twilight of the Ideal

Section I - 138: magic of self-hidden light


10.01_138:001 - All still was darkness dread and desolate; / There was no change nor any hope of change.

10.01_138:002 - In this black dream which was a house of Void, / A walk to Nowhere in a land of Nought, / Ever they drifted without aim or goal; / Gloom led to worse gloom, death to an emptier death, / In some positive Non-Being’s purposeless Vast / Through formless wastes dumb and unknowable.

10.01_138:003 - An ineffectual beam of suffering light / Through the despairing darkness dogged their steps / Like the remembrance of a glory lost; / Even while it grew, it seemed unreal there, / Yet haunted Nihil’s chill stupendous realm, / Unquenchable, perpetual, lonely, null, / A pallid ghost of some dead eternity.

10.01_138:004 - It was as if she must pay now her debt, / Her vain presumption to exist and think, / To some brilliant Maya that conceived her soul.

10.01_138:005 - This most she must absolve with endless pangs, / Her deep original sin, the will to be / And the sin last, greatest, the spiritual pride, / That, made of dust, equalled itself with heaven, / Its scorn of the worm writhing in the mud, / Condemned, ephemeral, born from Nature’s dream, / Refusal of the transient creature’s role, / The claim to be a living fire of God, / The will to be immortal and divine.

10.01_138:006 - In that tremendous darkness heavy and bare / She atoned for all since the first act whence sprang / The error of the consciousness of Time, / The rending of the Inconscient’s seal of sleep, / The primal and unpardoned revolt that broke / The peace and silence of the Nothingness / Which was before a seeming universe / Appeared in a vanity of imagined space / And life arose engendering grief and pain: / A great Negation was the Real’s face / Prohibiting the vain process of Time: / And when there is no world, no creature more, / When Time’s intrusion has been blotted out, / It shall last, unbodied, saved from thought, at peace.

10.01_138:007B - Accursed in what had been her godhead source, / Condemned to live for ever empty of bliss, / Her immortality her chastisement, / Her spirit, guilty of being, wandered doomed, / Moving for ever through eternal Night.

10.01_138:008 - But Maya is a veil of the Absolute; / A Truth occult has made this mighty world: / The Eternal’s wisdom and self-knowledge act / In ignorant Mind and in the body’s steps.

10.01_138:009 - The Inconscient is the Superconscient’s sleep.

10.01_138:010 - An unintelligible Intelligence / Invents creation’s paradox profound; / Spiritual thought is crammed in Matter’s forms, / Unseen it throws out a dumb energy / And works a miracle by a machine.

10.01_138:011 - All here is a mystery of contraries: / Darkness a magic of self-hidden light, / Suffering some secret rapture’s tragic mask / And death an instrument of perpetual life.

10.01_138:012 - Although Death walks beside us on Life’s road, / A dim bystander at the body’s start / And a last judgment on man’s futile works, / Other is the riddle of its ambiguous face: / Death is a stair, a door, a stumbling stride / The soul must take to cross from birth to birth, / A grey defeat pregnant with victory, / A whip to lash us towards our deathless state.

10.01_138:013 - The inconscient world is the spirit’s self-made room, / Eternal Night shadow of eternal Day.

10.01_138:014 - Night is not our beginning nor our end; / She is the dark Mother in whose womb we have hid / Safe from too swift a waking to world-pain.

10.01_138:015 - We came to her from a supernal Light, / By Light we live and to the Light we go.

10.01_138:016 - Here in this seat of Darkness mute and lone, / In the heart of everlasting Nothingness / Light conquered now even by that feeble beam: / Its faint infiltration drilled the blind deaf mass; / Almost it changed into a glimmering sight / That housed the phantom of an aureate Sun / Whose orb pupilled the eye of Nothingness.

10.01_138:017 - A golden fire came in and burnt Night’s heart; / Her dusky mindlessness began to dream; / The Inconscient conscious grew, Night felt and thought.

10.01_138:018 - Assailed in the sovereign emptiness of its reign / The intolerant Darkness paled and drew apart / Till only a few black remnants stained that Ray.

10.01_138:019 - But on a failing edge of dumb lost space / Still a great dragon body sullenly loomed; / Adversary of the slow struggling Dawn / Defending its ground of tortured mystery, / It trailed its coils through the dead martyred air / And curving fled down a grey slope of Time.


Section I - 139: finds his dreams were true


10.01_139:001 - There is a morning twilight of the gods; / Miraculous from sleep their forms arise / And God’s long nights are justified by dawn.

10.01_139:002 - There breaks a passion and splendour of new birth / And hue-winged visions stray across the lids, / The dreaming deities look beyond the seen / And fashion in their thoughts the ideal worlds / Sprung from a limitless moment of desire / That once had lodged in some abysmal heart. #favorite

10.01_139:003 - Passed was the heaviness of the eyeless dark / And all the sorrow of the night was dead: / Surprised by a blind joy with groping hands / Like one who wakes to find his dreams were true, / Into a happy misty twilit world / Where all ran after light and joy and love / She slipped; there far-off raptures drew more close / And deep anticipations of delight / For ever eager to be grasped and held, / Were never grasped, yet breathed strange ecstasy.

10.01_139:004 - A pearl-winged indistinctness fleeting swam, / An air that dared not suffer too much light.

10.01_139:005 - Vague fields were there, vague pastures gleaned, vague trees, / Vague scenes dim-hearted in a drifting haze; / Vague cattle white roamed glimmering through the mist; / Vague spirits wandered with a bodiless cry, / Vague melodies touched the soul and fled pursued / Into harmonious distances unseized; / Forms subtly elusive and half-luminous powers / Wishing no goal for their unearthly course / Strayed happily through vague ideal lands / Or floated without footing or their walk / Left steps of reverie on sweet memory’s ground; / Or they paced to the mighty measure of their thoughts / Led by a low far chanting of the gods.

10.01_139:006 - A ripple of gleaming wings crossed the far sky; / Birds like pale-bosomed imaginations flew / With low disturbing voices of desire, / And half-heard lowings drew the listening ear, / As if the Sun-god’s brilliant kine were there / Hidden in mist and passing towards the sun.

10.01_139:007 - These fugitive beings, these elusive shapes / Were all that claimed the eye and met the soul, / The natural inhabitants of that world.

10.01_139:008 - But nothing there was fixed or stayed for long; / No mortal feet could rest upon that soil, / No breath of life lingered embodied there.

10.01_139:009 - In that fine chaos joy fled dancing past / And beauty evaded settled line and form / And hid its sense in mysteries of hue; / Yet gladness ever repeated the same notes / And gave the sense of an enduring world; / There was a strange consistency of shapes, / And the same thoughts were constant passers-by / And all renewed unendingly its charm / Alluring ever the expectant heart / Like music that one always waits to hear / Like the recurrence of a haunting rhyme.

10.01_139:010 - One touched incessantly things never seized, / A skirt of worlds invisibly divine.

10.01_139:011 - As if a trail of disappearing stars / There showered upon the floating atmosphere / Colours and lights and evanescent gleams / That called to follow into magic heaven, / And in each cry that fainted on the ear / There was the voice of an unrealised bliss.

10.01_139:012 - An adoration reigned in the yearning heart, / A spirit of purity, an elusive presence / Of faery beauty and ungrasped delight / Whose momentary and escaping thrill, / However unsubstantial to our flesh, / And brief even in imperishableness, / Much sweeter seemed than any rapture known / Earth or all-conquering heaven can ever give.

10.01_139:013 - Heaven ever young and earth too firm and old / Delay the heart by immobility: / Their raptures of creation last too long, / Their bold formations are too absolute; / Carved by an anguish of divine endeavour / They stand up sculptured on the eternal hills, / Or quarried from the living rocks of God / Win immortality by perfect form.

10.01_139:014 - They are too intimate with eternal things: / Vessels of infinite significances, / They are too clear, too great, too meaningful; / No mist or shadow soothes the vanquished sight, / No soft penumbra of incertitude.

10.01_139:015 - These only touch a golden hem of bliss, / The gleaming shoulder of some godlike hope, / The flying feet of exquisite desires.

10.01_139:016 - On a slow trembling brink between night and day / They shone like visitants from the morning star, / Satisfied beginnings of perfection, first / Tremulous imaginings of a heavenly world: / They mingle in a passion of pursuit, / Thrilled with a spray of joy too slight to tire.

10.01_139:017 - All in this world was shadowed forth, not limned, / Like faces leaping on a fan of fire / Or shapes of wonder in a tinted blur, / Like fugitive landscapes painting silver mists.

10.01_139:018 - Here vision fled back from the sight alarmed, / And sound sought refuge from the ear’s surprise, / And all experience was a hasty joy.

10.01_139:019 - The joys here snatched were half-forbidden things, / Timorous soul-bridals delicately veiled / As when a goddess’ bosom dimly moves / To first desire and her white soul transfigured, / A glimmering Eden crossed by fairy gleams, / Trembles to expectation’s fiery wand, / But nothing is familiar yet with bliss.

10.01_139:020 - All things in this fair realm were heavenly strange / In a fleeting gladness of untired delight, / In an insistency of magic change.

10.01_139:021 - Past vanishing hedges, hurrying hints of fields, / Mid swift escaping lanes that fled her feet / Journeying she wished no end: as one through clouds / Travels upon a mountain ridge and hears / Arising to him out of hidden depths / Sound of invisible streams, she walked besieged / By the illusion of a mystic space, / A charm of bodiless touches felt and heard / A sweetness as of voices high and dim / Calling like travellers upon seeking winds / Melodiously with an alluring cry.

10.01_139:022 - As if a music old yet ever new, / Moving suggestions on her heart-strings dwelt, / Thoughts that no habitation found, yet clung / With passionate repetition to her mind, / Desires that hurt not, happy only to live / Always the same and always unfulfilled / Sang in the breast like a celestial lyre.

10.01_139:023 - Thus all could last, yet nothing ever be.

10.01_139:024 - In this beauty as of mind made visible, / Dressed in its rays of wonder Satyavan / Before her seemed the centre of its charm, / Head of her loveliness of longing dreams / And captain of the fancies of her soul.

10.01_139:025 - Even the dreadful majesty of Death’s face / And its sombre sadness could not darken nor slay / The intangible lustre of those fleeting skies.

10.01_139:026 - The sombre Shadow sullen, implacable / Made beauty and laughter more imperative; / Enhanced by his grey, joy grew more bright and dear; / His dark contrast edging ideal sight / Deepened unuttered meanings to the heart; / Pain grew a trembling undertone of bliss / And transience immortality’s floating hem, / A moment’s robe in which she looked more fair, / Its antithesis sharpening her divinity.

10.01_139:027 - A comrade of the Ray and Mist and Flame, / By a moon-bright face a brilliant moment drawn, / Almost she seemed a thought mid floating thoughts, / Seen hardly by a visionary mind / Amid the white inward musings of the soul / Half-vanquished by the dream-happiness around, / Awhile she moved on an enchantment’s soil, / But still remained possessor of her soul.

10.01_139:028 - Above, her spirit in its mighty trance / Saw all, but lived for its transcendent task, / Immutable like a fixed eternal star.


Canto 2 - 10.2: The Gospel of Death and Vanity of the Ideal

Section I - 140: ?


10.02_140:001 - Then pealed the calm inexorable voice: / Abolishing hope, cancelling life’s golden truths, / Fatal its accents smote the trembling air.

10.02_140:002 - That lovely world swam thin and frail, most like / Some pearly evanescent farewell gleam / On the faint verge of dusk in moonless eves.

10.02_140:003 - “Prisoner of Nature, many-visioned spirit, / Thought’s creature in the ideal’s realm enjoying / Thy unsubstantial immortality / The subtle marvellous mind of man has feigned, / This is the world from which thy yearnings came.

10.02_140:004 - When it would build eternity from the dust, / Man’s thought paints images illusion rounds; / Prophesying glories it shall never see, / It labours delicately among its dreams.

10.02_140:005 - Behold this fleeing of light-tasselled shapes, / Aerial raiment of unbodied gods; / A rapture of things that never can be born, / Hope chants to hope a bright immortal choir; / Cloud satisfies cloud, phantom to longing phantom / Leans sweetly, sweetly is clasped or sweetly chased.

10.02_140:006 - This is the stuff from which the ideal is formed: / Its builder is thought, its base the heart’s desire, / But nothing real answers to their call.

10.02_140:007 - The ideal dwells not in heaven, nor on the earth, / A bright delirium of man’s ardour of hope / Drunk with the wine of its own phantasy.

10.02_140:008 - It is a brilliant shadow’s dreamy trail.

10.02_140:009 - Thy vision’s error builds the azure skies, / Thy vision’s error drew the rainbow’s arch; / Thy mortal longing made for thee a soul.

10.02_140:010 - This angel in thy body thou callst love, / Who shapes his wings from thy emotion’s hues, / In a ferment of thy body has been born / And with the body that housed it it must die.

10.02_140:011 - It is a passion of thy yearning cells, / It is flesh that calls to flesh to serve its lust; / It is thy mind that seeks an answering mind / And dreams awhile that it has found its mate; / It is thy life that asks a human prop / To uphold its weakness lonely in the world / Or feeds its hunger on another’s life.

10.02_140:012 - A beast of prey that pauses in its prowl, / It crouches under a bush in splendid flower / To seize a heart and body for its food: / This beast thou dreamst immortal and a god.

10.02_140:013 - O human mind, vainly thou torturest / An hour’s delight to stretch through infinity’s / Long void and fill its formless, passionless gulfs, / Persuading the insensible Abyss / To lend eternity to perishing things, / And trickst the fragile movements of thy heart / With thy spirit’s feint of immortality.

10.02_140:014 - All here emerges born from Nothingness; / Encircled it lasts by the emptiness of Space, / Awhile upheld by an unknowing Force, / Then crumbles back into its parent Nought: / Only the Mute alone can ever be.

10.02_140:015 - In the Alone there is no room for love.

10.02_140:016 - In vain to clothe love’s perishable mud / Thou hast woven on the Immortal’s borrowed loom / The ideal’s gorgeous and unfading robe.

10.02_140:017 - The ideal never yet was real made.

10.02_140:018 - Imprisoned in form that glory cannot live; / Into a body shut it breathes no more.

10.02_140:019 - Intangible, remote, for ever pure, / A sovereign of its own brilliant void, / Unwillingly it descends to earthly air / To inhabit a white temple in man’s heart: / In his heart it shines rejected by his life.

10.02_140:020 - Immutable, bodiless, beautiful, grand and dumb, / Immobile on its shining throne it sits; / Dumb it receives his offering and his prayer.

10.02_140:021 - It has no voice to answer to his call, / No feet that move, no hands to take his gifts: / Aerial statue of the nude Idea, / Virgin conception of a bodiless god, / Its light stirs man the thinker to create / An earthly semblance of diviner things.

10.02_140:022 - Its hued reflection falls upon man’s acts; / His institutions are its cenotaphs, / He signs his dead conventions with its name; / His virtues don the Ideal’s skiey robe / And a nimbus of the outline of its face: / He hides their littleness with the divine Name.

10.02_140:023 - Yet insufficient is the bright pretence / To screen their indigent and earthy make: / Earth only is there and not some heavenly source.

10.02_140:024 - If heavens there are they are veiled in their own light, / If a Truth eternal somewhere reigns unknown, / It burns in a tremendous void of God; / For truth shines far from the falsehoods of the world; / How can the heavens come down to unhappy earth / Or the eternal lodge in drifting time?

10.02_140:025 - How shall the Ideal tread earth’s dolorous soil / Where life is only a labour and a hope, / A child of Matter and by Matter fed, / A fire flaming low in Nature’s grate, / A journey’s toilsome trudge with death for goal?

10.02_140:026 - The Avatars have lived and died in vain, / Vain was the sage’s thought, the prophet’s voice; / In vain is seen the shining upward Way.

10.02_140:027 - Earth lies unchanged beneath the circling sun; / She loves her fall and no omnipotence / Her mortal imperfections can erase, / Force on man’s crooked ignorance Heaven’s straight line / Or colonise a world of death with gods.

10.02_140:028 - O traveller in the chariot of the Sun, / High priestess in the holy fancy’s shrine / Who with a magic ritual in earth’s house / Worshippest ideal and eternal love, / What is this love thy thought has deified, / This sacred legend and immortal myth?

10.02_140:029 - It is a conscious yearning of thy flesh, / It is a glorious burning of thy nerves, / A rose of dream-splendour petalling thy mind, / A great red rapture and torture of thy heart.

10.02_140:030 - A sudden transfiguration of thy days, / It passes and the world is as before.

10.02_140:031 - A ravishing edge of sweetness and of pain, / A thrill in its yearning makes it seem divine, / A golden bridge across the roar of the years, / A cord tying thee to eternity.

10.02_140:032 - And yet how brief and frail! how soon is spent / This treasure wasted by the gods on man, / This happy closeness as of soul to soul, / This honey of the body’s companionship, / This heightened joy, this ecstasy in the veins, / This strange illumination of the sense!

10.02_140:033 - If Satyavan had lived, love would have died; / But Satyavan is dead and love shall live / A little while in thy sad breast, until / His face and body fade on memory’s wall / Where other bodies, other faces come.

10.02_140:034 - When love breaks suddenly into the life / At first man steps into a world of the sun; / In his passion he feels his heavenly element: / But only a fine sunlit patch of earth / The marvellous aspect took of heaven’s outburst.

10.02_140:035 - The snake is there and the worm in the heart of the rose.

10.02_140:036 - A word, a moment’s act can slay the god; / Precarious is his immortality, / He has a thousand ways to suffer and die; / Love cannot live by heavenly food alone, / Only on sap of earth can it survive.

10.02_140:037 - For thy passion was a sensual want refined; / A hunger of the body and the heart; / Thy want can tire and cease or turn elsewhere / Or love may meet a dire and pitiless end / By bitter treason, or wrath with cruel wounds / Separate, or thy unsatisfied will to others / Depart when first love’s joy lies stripped and slain: / A dull indifference replaces fire / Or an endearing habit imitates love: / An outward and uneasy union lasts / Or the routine of a life’s compromise.

10.02_140:038 - Where once the seed of oneness had been cast / Into a semblance of spiritual ground / By a divine adventure of heavenly powers / Two strive, constant associates without joy, / Two egos straining in a single leash, / Two minds divided by their jarring thoughts, / Two spirits disjoined, for ever separate.

10.02_140:039 - Thus is the ideal falsified in man’s world; / Trivial or sombre, disillusion comes, / Life’s harsh reality stares at the soul: / Heaven’s hour adjourned flees into bodiless Time.

10.02_140:040 - Death saves thee from this and saves Satyavan: / He now is safe, delivered from himself; / He travels to silence and felicity.

10.02_140:041 - Call him not back to the treacheries of earth / And the poor petty life of animal Man.

10.02_140:042 - In my vast tranquil spaces let him sleep / In harmony with the mighty hush of death / Where love lies slumbering on the breast of peace.

10.02_140:043 - And thou, go back alone to thy frail world: / Chastise thy heart with knowledge, unhood and see / Thy nature raised into clear living heights, / The heaven-bird’s view from unimagined peaks.

10.02_140:044 - For when thou givest thy spirit to a dream / Soon hard necessity will smite thee awake: / Purest delight began and it must end.

10.02_140:045 - Thou too shall know thy heart no anchor swinging / Thy cradled soul moored in eternal seas.

10.02_140:046 - Vain are the cycles of thy brilliant mind.

10.02_140:047 - Renounce, forgetting joy and hope and tears / Thy passionate nature in the bosom profound / Of a happy Nothingness and wordless Calm, / Delivered into my mysterious rest.

10.02_140:048 - One with my fathomless Nihil all forget.

10.02_140:049 - Forget thy fruitless spirit’s waste of force, / Forget the weary circle of thy birth, / Forget the joy and the struggle and the pain, / The vague spiritual quest which first began / When worlds broke forth like clusters of fire-flowers, / And great burning thoughts voyaged through the sky of mind / And Time and its aeons crawled across the vasts / And souls emerged into mortality."

10.02_140:050 - But Savitri replied to the dark Power: / “A dangerous music now thou findst, O Death, / Melting thy speech into harmonious pain, / And flut’st alluringly to tired hopes / Thy falsehoods mingled with sad strains of truth.

10.02_140:051 - But I forbid thy voice to slay my soul.

10.02_140:052 - My love is not a hunger of the heart, / My love is not a craving of the flesh; / It came to me from God, to God returns.

10.02_140:053 - Even in all that life and man have marred, / A whisper of divinity still is heard, / A breath is felt from the eternal spheres.

10.02_140:054 - Allowed by Heaven and wonderful to man / A sweet fire-rhythm of passion chants to love.

10.02_140:055 - There is a hope in its wild infinite cry; / It rings with callings from forgotten heights, / And when its strains are hushed to high-winged souls / In their empyrean, its burning breath / Survives beyond, the rapturous core of suns / That flame for ever pure in skies unseen, / A voice of the eternal Ecstasy.

10.02_140:056 - One day I shall behold my great sweet world / Put off the dire disguises of the gods, / Unveil from terror and disrobe from sin.

10.02_140:057 - Appeased we shall draw near our Mother’s face, / We shall cast our candid souls upon her lap; / Then shall we clasp the ecstasy we chase, / Then shall we shudder with the long-sought god, / Then shall we find Heaven’s unexpected strain.

10.02_140:058 - Not only is there hope for godheads pure; / The violent and darkened deities / Leaped down from the one breast in rage to find / What the white gods had missed: they too are safe; / A Mother’s eyes are on them and her arms / Stretched out in love desire her rebel sons.

10.02_140:059 - One who came, love and lover and beloved / Eternal, built himself a wondrous field / And wove the measures of a marvellous dance.

10.02_140:060 - There in its circles and its magic turns / Attracted he arrives, repelled he flees.

10.02_140:061 - In the wild devious promptings of his mind / He tastes the honey of tears and puts off joy / Repenting, and has laughter and has wrath, / And both are a broken music of the soul / Which seeks out, reconciled, its heavenly rhyme.

10.02_140:062 - Ever he comes to us across the years / Bearing a sweet new face that is the old.

10.02_140:063 - His bliss laughs to us or it calls concealed / Like a far-heard unseen entrancing flute / From moonlit branches in the throbbing woods, / Tempting our angry search and passionate pain.

10.02_140:064 - Disguised the Lover seeks and draws our souls.

10.02_140:065 - He named himself for me, grew Satyavan.

10.02_140:066 - For we are man and woman from the first, / The twin souls born from one undying fire.

10.02_140:067 - Did he not dawn on me in other stars?

10.02_140:068 - How has he through the thickets of the world / Pursued me like a lion in the night / And come upon me suddenly in the ways / And seized me with his glorious golden leap!

10.02_140:069 - Unsatisfied he yearned for me through time, / Sometimes with wrath and sometimes with sweet peace, / Desiring me since first the world began.

10.02_140:070 - He rose like a wild wave out of the floods / And dragged me helpless into seas of bliss.

10.02_140:071 - Out of my curtained past his arms arrived; / They have touched me like the soft persuading wind, / They have plucked me like a glad and trembling flower, / And clasped me happily burned in ruthless flame.

10.02_140:072 - I too have found him charmed in lovely forms / And run delighted to his distant voice / And pressed to him past many dreadful bars.

10.02_140:073 - If there is a yet happier greater god, / Let him first wear the face of Satyavan / And let his soul be one with him I love; / So let him seek me that I may desire.

10.02_140:074 - For only one heart beats within my breast / And one god sits there throned. Advance, O Death, / Beyond the phantom beauty of this world; / For of its citizens I am not one.

10.02_140:075 - I cherish God the Fire, not God the Dream."

10.02_140:076 - But Death once more inflicted on her heart / The majesty of his calm and dreadful voice: / “A bright hallucination are thy thoughts.

10.02_140:077 - A prisoner haled by a spiritual cord, / Of thy own sensuous will the ardent slave, / Thou sendest eagle-poised to meet the sun / Words winged with the red splendour of thy heart.

10.02_140:078 - But knowledge dwells not in the passionate heart; / The heart’s words fall back unheard from Wisdom’s throne.

10.02_140:079 - Vain is thy longing to build heaven on earth.

10.02_140:080 - Artificer of Ideal and Idea, / Mind, child of Matter in the womb of Life, / To higher levels persuades his parents’ steps, / Inapt, they follow ill the daring guide.

10.02_140:081 - But Mind, a glorious traveller in the sky, / Walks lamely on the earth with footsteps slow; / Hardly he can mould the life’s rebellious stuff, / Hardly can he hold the galloping hooves of sense: / His thoughts look straight into the very heavens; / They draw their gold from a celestial mine, / His acts work painfully a common ore.

10.02_140:082 - All thy high dreams were made by Matter’s mind / To solace its dull work in Matter’s jail, / Its only house where it alone seems true.

10.02_140:083 - A solid image of reality / Carved out being to prop the works of Time; / Matter on the firm earth sits strong and sure.

10.02_140:084 - It is the first-born of created things, / It stands the last when mind and life are slain, / And if it ended all would cease to be.

10.02_140:085 - All else is only its outcome or its phase: / Thy soul is a brief flower by the gardener Mind / Created on thy Matter’s terrain plot; / It perishes with the plant on which it grows, / For from earth’s sap it draws its heavenly hue: / Thy thoughts are gleams that pass on Matter’s verge, / Thy life a lapsing wave on Matter’s sea.

10.02_140:086 - A careful steward of Truth’s limited means, / Treasuring her founded facts from the squandering Power, / It tethers mind to the tent-posts of sense, / To a leaden grey routine clamps Life’s caprice / And ties all creatures with the cords of Law.

10.02_140:087 - A vessel of transmuting alchemies, / A glue that sticks together mind and life, / If Matter fails, all crumbling cracks and falls.

10.02_140:088 - All upon Matter stands as on a rock.

10.02_140:089 - Yet this security and guarantor / Pressed for credentials an impostor proves: / A cheat of substance where no substance is, / An appearance and a symbol and a nought, / Its forms have no original right to birth: / Its aspect of a fixed stability / Is the cover of a captive motion’s swirl, / An order of the steps of Energy’s dance / Whose footmarks leave for ever the same signs, / A concrete face of unsubstantial Time, / A trickle dotting the emptiness of Space: / A stable-seeming movement without change, / Yet change arrives and the last change is death.

10.02_140:090 - What seemed most real once, is Nihil’s show.

10.02_140:091 - Its figures are snares that trap and prison the sense; / The beginningless void was its artificer: / Nothing is there but aspects limned by Chance / And seeming shapes of seeming Energy.

10.02_140:092 - All by Death’s mercy breathe and live awhile, / All think and act by the Inconscient’s grace.

10.02_140:093 - Addict of the roseate luxury of thy thoughts, / Turn not thy gaze within thyself to look / At visions in the gleaming crystal, Mind, / Close not thy lids to dream the forms of Gods.

10.02_140:094 - At last to open thy eyes consent and see / The stuff of which thou and the world are made.

10.02_140:095 - Inconscient in the still inconscient Void / Inexplicably a moving world sprang forth: / Awhile secure, happily insensible, / It could not rest content with its own truth.

10.02_140:096 - For something on its nescient breast was born / Condemned to see and know, to feel and love, / It watched its acts, imagined a soul within; / It groped for truth and dreamed of Self and God.

10.02_140:097 - When all unconscious was, then all was well.

10.02_140:098 - I, Death, was king and kept my regal state, / Designing my unwilled, unerring plan, / Creating with a calm insentient heart.

10.02_140:099 - In my sovereign power of unreality / Obliging nothingness to take a form, / Infallibly my blind unthinking force / Making by chance a fixity like fate’s, / By whim the formulas of Necessity, / Founded on the hollow ground of the Inane / The sure bizarrerie of Nature’s scheme.

10.02_140:100 - I curbed the vacant ether into Space; / A huge expanding and contracting breath / Harboured the fires of the universe: / I struck out the supreme original spark / And spread its sparse ranked armies through the Inane, / Manufactured the stars from the occult radiances, / Marshalled the platoons of the invisible dance; / I formed earth’s beauty out of atom and gas, / And built from chemic plasm the living man.

10.02_140:101 - Then Thought came in and spoilt the harmonious world: / Matter began to hope and think and feel, / Tissue and nerve bore joy and agony.

10.02_140:102 - The inconscient cosmos strove to learn its task; / An ignorant personal god was born in Mind / And to understand invented reason’s law, / The impersonal Vast throbbed back to man’s desire, / A trouble rocked the great world’s blind still heart / And Nature lost her wide immortal calm.

10.02_140:103 - Thus came this warped incomprehensible scene / Of souls enmeshed in life’s delight and pain / And Matter’s sleep and Mind’s mortality, / Of beings in Nature’s prison waiting death / And consciousness left in seeking ignorance.

10.02_140:104 - This is the world in which thou movst, astray / In the tangled pathways of the human mind, / In the issueless circling of thy human life, / Searching for thy soul and thinking God is here.

10.02_140:105 - But where is room for soul or place for God / In the brute immensity of a machine?

10.02_140:106 - A transient Breath thou takest for thy soul, / Born from a gas, a plasm, a sperm, a gene, / A magnified image of man’s mind for God, / A shadow of thyself thrown upon Space.

10.02_140:107 - Interposed between the upper and nether Void, / Thy consciousness reflects the world around / In the distorting mirror of Ignorance / Or upwards turns to catch imagined stars.

10.02_140:108 - Or if a half Truth is playing with the earth / Throwing its light on a dark shadowy ground, / It touches only and leaves a luminous smudge.

10.02_140:109 - Immortality thou claimest for thy spirit, / But immortality for imperfect man, / A god who hurts himself at every step, / Would be a cycle of eternal pain.

10.02_140:110 - Wisdom and love thou claimest as thy right; / But knowledge in this world is error’s make, / A brilliant procuress of Nescience / And human love a posturer on earth-stage / Who imitates with verve a faery dance.

10.02_140:111 - An extract pressed from hard experience, / Man’s knowledge casked in the barrels of Memory / Has the harsh savour of a mortal draught: / A sweet secretion from the erotic glands / Flattering and torturing the burning nerves, / Love is a honey and poison in the breast / Drunk by it as the nectar of the gods.

10.02_140:112 - Earth’s human wisdom is no great-browed power, / And love no gleaming angel from the skies.

10.02_140:113 - If they aspire beyond earth’s dullard air, / Arriving sunwards with frail waxen wings / How high could reach that forced unnatural flight?

10.02_140:114 - But not on earth can divine wisdom reign / And not on earth can divine love be found; / Heaven-born, only in heaven can they live, / Or else there too perhaps they are shining dreams.

10.02_140:115 - Nay, is not all thou art and doest a dream?

10.02_140:116 - Thy mind and life are tricks of Matter’s force.

10.02_140:117 - If thy mind seems to thee a radiant sun, / If thy life runs a swift and glorious dream, / This is the illusion of thy mortal heart / Dazzled by a ray of happiness or light.

10.02_140:118 - Impotent to live by their own right divine, / Convinced of their brilliant unreality, / When their supporting ground is cut away, / These children of Matter into Matter die.

10.02_140:119 - Even Matter vanishes into Energy’s vague / And Energy is a motion of old Nought.

10.02_140:120 - How shall the Ideal’s unsubstantial hues / Be painted stiff on earth’s vermilion blur, / A dream within a dream come doubly true?

10.02_140:121 - How shall the will-o’-the-wisp become a star?

10.02_140:122 - The Ideal is a malady of thy mind, / A bright delirium of thy speech and thought, / A strange wine of beauty lifting thee to false sight.

10.02_140:123 - A noble fiction of thy yearnings made, / Thy human imperfection it must share: / Its forms in Nature disappoint the heart, / And never shall it find its heavenly shape / And never can it be fulfilled in Time.

10.02_140:124 - O soul misled by the splendour of thy thoughts, / O earthly creature with thy dream of heaven, / Obey, resigned and still, the earthly law.

10.02_140:125 - Accept the light that falls upon thy days; / Take what thou canst of Life’s permitted joy, / Submitting to the ordeal of Fate’s scourge / Suffer what thou must of toil and grief and care.

10.02_140:126 - There shall approach silencing thy passionate heart / My long calm night of everlasting sleep: / There into the hush from which thou cam’st retire."


Canto 3 - 10.3: The Debate of Love and Death

Section I - 141: how shall the child already be the man


10.03_141:001 - A sad destroying cadence the voice sank; / It seemed to lead the advancing march of Life / Into some still original Inane.

10.03_141:002 - But Savitri answered to almighty Death: / “O dark-browed sophist of the universe / Who veilst the Real with its own Idea, / Hiding with brute objects Nature’s living face, / Masking eternity with thy dance of death, / Thou hast woven the ignorant Mind into a screen / And made of Thought error’s purveyor and scribe, / And a false witness of mind’s servant sense.

10.03_141:003 - An aesthete of the sorrow of the world, / Champion of a harsh and sad philosophy / Thou hast used words to shutter out the Light / And called in Truth to vindicate a lie.

10.03_141:004 - A lying reality is falsehood’s crown / And a perverted truth her richest gem.

10.03_141:005 - O Death, thou speakest Truth but Truth that slays, / I answer to thee with the Truth that saves.

10.03_141:006 - A traveller new-discovering himself, / One made of Matter’s world his starting-point, / He made of Nothingness his living-room / And Night a process of the eternal light / And death a spur towards immortality.

10.03_141:007 - God wrapped his head from sight in Matter’s cowl, / His consciousness dived into inconscient depths, / All-knowledge seemed a huge dark Nescience; / Infinity wore a boundless zero’s form.

10.03_141:008 - His abysms of bliss became insensible deeps, / Eternity a blank spiritual Vast.

10.03_141:009 - Annulling an original nullity, / The Timeless took its ground in emptiness / And drew the figure of a universe, / That the spirit might adventure into Time / And wrestle with adamant Necessity / And the soul pursue a cosmic pilgrimage.

10.03_141:010 - A spirit moved in black immensities / And built a Thought in ancient Nothingness; / A soul in God’s tremendous Void was lit, / A secret labouring glow of nascent fire.

10.03_141:011 - In Nihil’s gulf his mighty Puissance wrought; / She swung her formless motion into shapes, / Made Matter the body of the Bodiless.

10.03_141:012 - Infant and dim the eternal Mights awoke.

10.03_141:013 - In inert Matter breathed a slumbering Life, / In a subconscient Life Mind lay asleep; / In waking Life it stretched its giant limbs / To shake from it the torpor of its drowse; / A senseless substance quivered into sense, / The world’s heart commenced to beat, its eyes to see.

10.03_141:014 - In the crowded dumb vibrations of a brain / Thought fumbled in a ring to find itself, / Discovered speech and fed the new-born Word / That bridged with spans of light the world’s ignorance.

10.03_141:015 - In waking Mind, the Thinker built his house.

10.03_141:016 - A reasoning animal willed and planned and sought; / He stood erect among his brute compeers, / He built life new, measured the universe, / Opposed his fate and wrestled with unseen Powers, / Conquered and used the laws that rule the world, / And hoped to ride the heavens and reach the stars, / A master of his huge environment.

10.03_141:017 - Now through Mind’s windows stares the demi-god / Hidden behind the curtains of man’s soul: / He has seen the Unknown, looked on Truth’s veilless face; / A ray has touched him from the eternal Sun; / Motionless, voiceless in foreseeing depths, / He stands awake in Supernature’s light / And sees a glory of arisen wings / And sees the vast descending might of God.

10.03_141:018 - O Death, thou lookst on an unfinished world / Assailed by thee and of its road unsure, / Peopled by imperfect minds and ignorant lives, / And sayest God is not and all is vain.

10.03_141:019 - How shall the child already be the man?

10.03_141:020 - Because he is infant, shall he never grow?

10.03_141:021 - Because he is ignorant, shall he never learn?

10.03_141:022 - In a small fragile seed a great tree lurks, / In a tiny gene a thinking being is shut; / A little element in a little sperm, / It grows and is a conqueror and a sage.

10.03_141:023 - Then wilt thou spew out, Death, God’s mystic truth, / Deny the occult spiritual miracle?

10.03_141:024 - Still wilt thou say there is no spirit, no God?

10.03_141:025 - A mute material Nature wakes and sees; / She has invented speech, unveiled a will.

10.03_141:026 - Something there waits beyond towards which she strives, / Something surrounds her into which she grows: / To uncover the spirit, to change back into God, / To exceed herself is her transcendent task.

10.03_141:027 - In God concealed the world began to be, / Tardily it travels towards manifest God: / Our imperfection towards perfection toils, / The body is the chrysalis of a soul: / The infinite holds the finite in its arms, / Time travels towards revealed eternity.

10.03_141:028 - A miracle structure of the eternal Mage, / Matter its mystery hides from its own eyes, / A scripture written out in cryptic signs, / An occult document of the All-Wonderful’s art.

10.03_141:029 - All here bears witness to his secret might, / In all we feel his presence and his power.

10.03_141:030 - A blaze of his sovereign glory is the sun, / A glory is the gold and glimmering moon.

10.03_141:031 - A glory is his dream of purple sky.

10.03_141:032 - A march of his greatness are the wheeling stars.

10.03_141:033 - His laughter of beauty breaks out in green trees, / His moments of beauty triumph in a flower; / The blue sea’s chant, the rivulet’s wandering voice / Are murmurs falling from the Eternal’s harp.

10.03_141:034 - This world is God fulfilled in outwardness.

10.03_141:035 - His ways challenge our reason and our sense; / By blind brute movements of an ignorant Force, / By means we slight as small, obscure or base / A greatness founded upon little things, / He has built a world in the unknowing Void.

10.03_141:036 - His forms he has massed from infinitesimal dust; / His marvels are built from insignificant things.

10.03_141:037 - If mind is crippled, life untaught and crude, / If brutal masks are there and evil acts, / They are incidents of his vast and varied plot, / His great and dangerous drama’s needed steps; / He makes with these and all his passion-play, / A play and yet no play but the deep scheme / Of a transcendent Wisdom finding ways / To meet her Lord in the shadow and the Night: / Above her is the vigil of the stars; / Watched by a solitary Infinitude / She embodies in dumb Matter the Divine, / In symbol minds and lives the Absolute.

10.03_141:038 - A miracle-monger her mechanical craft; / Matter’s machine worked out the laws of thought, / Life’s engines served the labour of a soul: / The mighty Mother her creation wrought, / A huge caprice self-bound by iron laws, / And shut God into an enigmatic world: / She lulled the Omniscient into nescient sleep, / Omnipotence on Inertia’s back she drove, / Trod perfectly with divine unconscious steps / The enormous circle of her wonder-works.

10.03_141:039 - Immortality assured itself by death; / The Eternal’s face was seen through drifts of Time.

10.03_141:040 - His knowledge he disguised as Ignorance, / His Good he sowed in Evil’s monstrous bed, / Made error a door by which Truth could enter in, / His plant of bliss watered with Sorrow’s tears.

10.03_141:041 - A thousand aspects point back to the One; / A dual Nature covered the Unique.

10.03_141:042 - In this meeting of the Eternal’s mingling masques, / This tangle-dance of passionate contraries / Locking like lovers in a forbidden embrace / The quarrel of their lost identity, / In this wrestle and wrangle of the extremes of Power / Earth’s million roads struggled towards deity.

10.03_141:043 - All stumbled on behind a stumbling Guide, / Yet every stumble is a needed pace / On unknown routes to an unknowable goal.

10.03_141:044 - All blundered and straggled towards the one Divine.

10.03_141:045 - As if transmuted by a titan spell / The eternal powers assumed a dubious face: / Idols of an oblique divinity, / They wore the heads of animal or troll, / Assumed ears of the fawn, the satyr’s hoof, / Or harboured the demoniac in their gaze.

10.03_141:046 - A crooked maze they made of thinking mind, / They suffered a metamorphosis of the heart, / Admitting Bacchant revellers from the Night / Into its sanctuary of delights, / As in a Dionysian masquerade.

10.03_141:047 - On the highways, in the gardens of the world / They wallowed oblivious of their divine parts, / As drunkards of a dire Circean wine / Or a child who sprawls and sports in Nature’s mire.

10.03_141:048 - Even wisdom, hewer of the roads of God, / Is a partner in the deep disastrous game: / Lost is the pilgrim’s wallet and the scrip, / She fails to read the map and watch the star.

10.03_141:049 - A poor self-righteous virtue is her stock / And reason’s pragmatic grope or abstract sight, / Or the technique of a brief hour’s success / She teaches, an usher in utility’s school.

10.03_141:050 - On the ocean surface of vast Consciousness / Small thoughts in shoals are fished up into a net / But the great truths escape her narrow cast; / Guarded from vision by creation’s depths, / Obscure they swim in blind enormous gulfs / Safe from the little sounding leads of mind, / Too far for the puny diver’s shallow plunge.

10.03_141:051 - Our mortal vision peers with ignorant eyes; / It has no gaze on the deep heart of things.

10.03_141:052 - Our knowledge walks leaning on Error’s staff, / A worshipper of false dogmas and false gods, / Or fanatic of a fierce intolerant creed / Or a seeker doubting every truth he finds, / A sceptic facing Light with adamant No / Or chilling the heart with dry ironic smile, / A cynic stamping out the god in man; / A darkness wallows in the paths of Time / Or lifts its giant head to blot the stars; / It makes a cloud of the interpreting mind / And intercepts the oracles of the Sun.

10.03_141:053A - Yet Light is there; it stands at Nature’s doors: / It holds a torch to lead the traveller in.

10.03_141:054 - It waits to be kindled in our secret cells; / It is a star lighting an ignorant sea, / A lamp upon our poop piercing the night.

10.03_141:055 - As knowledge grows Light flames up from within: / It is a shining warrior in the mind, / An eagle of dreams in the divining heart, / An armour in the fight, a bow of God.

10.03_141:056 - Then larger dawns arrive and Wisdom’s pomps / Cross through the being’s dim, half-lighted fields; / Philosophy climbs up Thought’s cloud-bank peaks / And Science tears out Nature’s occult powers, / Enormous jinns who serve a dwarf’s small needs, / Exposes the sealed minutiae of her art / And conquers her by her own captive force.

10.03_141:057 - On heights unreached by mind’s most daring soar, / Upon a dangerous edge of failing Time / The soul draws back into its deathless Self; / Man’s knowledge becomes God’s supernal Ray.

10.03_141:058 - There is the mystic realm whence leaps the power / Whose fire burns in the eyes of seer and sage; / A lightning flash of visionary sight, / It plays upon an inward verge of mind: / Thought silenced gazes into a brilliant Void.

10.03_141:059 - A voice comes down from mystic unseen peaks: / A cry of splendour from a mouth of storm, / It is the voice that speaks to night’s profound, / It is the thunder and the flaming call.

10.03_141:060 - Above the planes that climb from nescient earth, / A hand is lifted towards the Invisible’s realm, / Beyond the superconscient’s blinding line / And plucks away the screens of the Unknown; / A spirit within looks into the Eternal’s eyes.

10.03_141:061 - It hears the Word to which our hearts were deaf, / It sees through the blaze in which our thoughts grew blind; / It drinks from the naked breasts of glorious Truth, / It learns the secrets of eternity.

10.03_141:062 - Thus all was plunged into the riddling Night, / Thus all is raised to meet a dazzling Sun.

10.03_141:063 - O Death, this is the mystery of thy reign.

10.03_141:064 - In earth’s anomalous and tragic field / Carried in its aimless journey by the sun / Mid the forced marches of the great dumb stars, / A darkness occupied the fields of God, / And Matter’s world was governed by thy shape.

10.03_141:065 - Thy mask has covered the Eternal’s face, / The Bliss that made the world has fallen asleep.

10.03_141:066 - Abandoned in the Vast she slumbered on: / An evil transmutation overtook / Her members till she knew herself no more.

10.03_141:067 - Only through her creative slumber flit / Frail memories of the joy and beauty meant / Under the sky’s blue laugh mid green-scarfed trees / And happy squanderings of scents and hues, / In the field of the golden promenade of the sun / And the vigil of the dream-light of the stars, / Amid high meditating heads of hills, / On the bosom of voluptuous rain-kissed earth / And by the sapphire tumblings of the sea.

10.03_141:068 - But now the primal innocence is lost / And Death and Ignorance govern the mortal world / And Nature’s visage wears a greyer hue.

10.03_141:069 - Earth still has kept her early charm and grace, / The grandeur and the beauty still are hers, / But veiled is the divine Inhabitant.

10.03_141:070 - The souls of men have wandered from the Light / And the great Mother turns away her face.

10.03_141:071 - The eyes of the creatrix Bliss are closed / And sorrow’s touch has found her in her dreams.

10.03_141:072 - As she turns and tosses on her bed of Void, / Because she cannot wake and find herself / And cannot build again her perfect shape, / Oblivious of her nature and her state, / Forgetting her instinct of felicity, / Forgetting to create a world of joy, / She weeps and makes her creatures’ eyes to weep; / Testing with sorrow’s edge her children’s breasts, / She spends on life’s vain waste of hope and toil / The poignant luxury of grief and tears.

10.03_141:073 - In the nightmare change of her half-conscious dream, / Tortured herself and torturing by her touch, / She comes to our hearts and bodies and our lives / Wearing a hard and cruel mask of pain.

10.03_141:074 - Our nature twisted by the abortive birth / Returns wry answers to life’s questioning shocks, / An acrid relish finds in the world’s pangs, / Drinks the sharp wine of grief’s perversity.

10.03_141:075 - A curse is laid on the pure joy of life: / Delight, God’s sweetest sign and Beauty’s twin, / Dreaded by aspiring saint and austere sage, / Is shunned, a dangerous and ambiguous cheat, / A specious trick of an infernal Power / It tempts the soul to its self-hurt and fall.

10.03_141:076 - A puritan God made pleasure a poisonous fruit, / Or red drug in the market-place of Death, / And sin the child of Nature’s ecstasy.

10.03_141:077 - Yet every creature hunts for happiness, / Buys with harsh pangs or tears by violence / From the dull breast of the inanimate globe / Some fragment or some broken shard of bliss.

10.03_141:078 - Even joy itself becomes a poisonous draught, / Its hunger is made a dreadful hook of Fate.

10.03_141:079 - All means are held good to catch a single beam, / Eternity sacrificed for a moment’s bliss: / Yet for joy and not for sorrow earth was made / And not as a dream in endless suffering Time.

10.03_141:080 - Although God made the world for his delight, / An ignorant Power took charge and seemed his Will / And Death’s deep falsity has mastered Life.

10.03_141:081 - All grew a play of Chance simulating Fate.



Section I - 142: in every shrine it cries for the clasp of God


10.03_142:001 - A secret air of pure felicity / Deep like a sapphire heaven our spirits breathe; / Our hearts and bodies feel its obscure call, / Our senses grope for it and touch and lose.

10.03_142:002 - If this withdrew, the world would sink in the Void; / If this were not, nothing could move or live.

10.03_142:003 - A hidden Bliss is at the root of things.

10.03_142:004 - A mute Delight regards Time’s countless works: / To house God’s joy in things Space gave wide room, / To house God’s joy in self our souls were born.

10.03_142:005 - This universe an old enchantment guards; / Its objects are carved cups of World-Delight / Whose charmed wine is some deep soul’s rapture-drink: / The All-Wonderful has packed heaven with his dreams, / He has made blank ancient Space his marvel-house; / He spilled his spirit into Matter’s signs: / His fires of grandeur burn in the great sun, / He glides through heaven shimmering in the moon; / He is beauty carolling in the fields of sound; / He chants the stanzas of the odes of Wind; / He is silence watching in the stars at night; / He wakes at dawn and calls from every bough, / Lies stunned in the stone and dreams in flower and tree.

10.03_142:006 - Even in this labour and dolour of Ignorance, / On the hard perilous ground of difficult earth, / In spite of death and evil circumstance / A will to live persists, a joy to be.

10.03_142:007 - There is a joy in all that meets the sense, / A joy in all experience of the soul, / A joy in evil and a joy in good, / A joy in virtue and a joy in sin: / Indifferent to the threat of karmic law, / Joy dares to grow upon forbidden soil, / Its sap runs through the plant and flowers of Pain: / It thrills with the drama of fate and tragic doom, / It tears its food from sorrow and ecstasy, / On danger and difficulty whets its strength; / It wallows with the reptile and the worm / And lifts its head, an equal of the stars; / It shares the fairies’ dance, dines with the gnome: / It basks in the light and heat of many suns, / The sun of Beauty and the sun of Power / Flatter and foster it with golden beam; / It grows towards the Titan and the God.

10.03_142:008 - On earth it lingers drinking its deep fill, / Through the symbol of her pleasure and her pain, / Of the grapes of Heaven and the flowers of the Abyss, / Of the flame-stabs and the torment-craft of Hell / And dim fragments of the glory of Paradise.

10.03_142:009 - In the small paltry pleasures of man’s life, / In his petty passions and joys it finds a taste, / A taste in tears and torture of broken hearts, / In the crown of gold and in the crown of thorns, / In life’s nectar of sweetness and its bitter wine.

10.03_142:010 - All being it explores for unknown bliss, / Sounds all experience for things new and strange.

10.03_142:011 - Life brings into the earthly creature’s days / A tongue of glory from a higher sphere: / It deepens in his musings and his Art, / It leaps at the splendour of some perfect word, / It exults in his high resolves and noble deeds, / Wanders in his errors, dares the abyss’s brink, / It climbs in his climbings, wallows in his fall.

10.03_142:012 - Angel and demon brides his chamber share, / Possessors or competitors for life’s heart.

10.03_142:013 - To the enjoyer of the cosmic scene / His greatness and his littleness equal are, / His magnanimity and meanness hues / Cast on some neutral background of the gods: / The Artist’s skill he admires who made the plan, / But not for ever endures this danger game: / Beyond the earth, but meant for delivered earth, / Wisdom and joy prepare their perfect crown: / Truth superhuman calls to thinking man.

10.03_142:014 - At last the soul turns to eternal things, / In every shrine it cries for the clasp of God.

10.03_142:015 - Then is there played the crowning Mystery, / Then is achieved the longed-for miracle.

10.03_142:016 - Immortal bliss her wide celestial eyes / Opens on the stars, she stirs her mighty limbs; / Time thrills to the sapphics of her amour song / And Space fills with a white beatitude.

10.03_142:017 - Then leaving to its grief the human heart, / Abandoning speech and the name-determined realms, / Through a gleaming far-seen sky of wordless thought, / Through naked thought-free heavens of absolute sight, / She climbs to the summits where the unborn Idea / Remembering the future that must be / Looks down upon the works of labouring Force, / Immutable above the world it made.

10.03_142:018 - In the vast golden laughter of Truth’s sun / Like a great heaven-bird on a motionless sea / Is poised her winged ardour of creative joy / On the still deep of the Eternal’s peace.

10.03_142:019 - This was the aim, this the supernal Law, / Nature’s allotted task when beauty-drenched / In dim mist waters of inconscient sleep, / Out of the Void this grand creation rose,— / For this the Spirit came into the Abyss / And charged with its power Matter’s unknowing Force, / In Night’s bare session to cathedral light / In Death’s realm repatriate immortality.

10.03_142:020 - A mystic slow transfiguration works.

10.03_142:021 - All our earth starts from mud and ends in sky, / And Love that was once an animal’s desire, / Then a sweet madness in the rapturous heart, / An ardent comradeship in the happy mind, / Becomes a wide spiritual yearning’s space.

10.03_142:022 - A lonely soul passions for the Alone, / The heart that loved man thrills to the love of God, / A body is his chamber and his shrine.

10.03_142:023 - Then is our being rescued from separateness; / All is itself, all is new-felt in God: / A Lover leaning from his cloister’s door / Gathers the whole world into his single breast.

10.03_142:024 - Then shall the business fail of Night and Death: / When unity is won, when strife is lost / And all is known and all is clasped by Love / Who would turn back to ignorance and pain?

10.03_142:025 - O Death, I have triumphed over thee within; / I quiver no more with the assault of grief; / A mighty calmness seated deep within / Has occupied my body and my sense: / It takes the world’s grief and transmutes to strength, / It makes the world’s joy one with the joy of God.

10.03_142:026 - My love eternal sits throned on God’s calm; / For Love must soar beyond the very heavens / And find its secret sense ineffable; / It must change its human ways to ways divine, / Yet keep its sovereignty of earthly bliss.

10.03_142:027 - O Death, not for my heart’s sweet poignancy / Nor for my happy body’s bliss alone / I have claimed from thee the living Satyavan, / But for his work and mine, our sacred charge.

10.03_142:028 - Our lives are God’s messengers beneath the stars; / To dwell under death’s shadow they have come / Tempting God’s light to earth for the ignorant race, / His Love to fill the hollow in men’s hearts, / His bliss to heal the unhappiness of the world.

10.03_142:029 - For I the Woman am the force of God, / He the Eternal’s delegate sole in man.

10.03_142:030 - My will is greater than thy law, O Death; / My love is stronger than the bonds of Fate: / Our love is the heavenly seal of the Supreme.

10.03_142:031 - I guard that seal against thy rending hands.

10.03_142:032 - Love must not cease to live upon the earth; / For Love is the bright link twixt earth and heaven, / Love is the far Transcendent’s angel here; / Love is man’s lien on the Absolute."

10.03_142:033 - But to the woman Death the god replied, / With the ironic laughter of his voice / Discouraging the labour of the stars: / “Even so men cheat the Truth with splendid thoughts.

10.03_142:034 - Thus wilt thou hire the glorious charlatan Mind, / To weave from his Ideal’s gossamer air / A fine raiment for thy body’s nude desires / And thy heart’s clutching greedy passion clothe?

10.03_142:035 - Daub not the web of life with magic hues: / Make rather thy thought a plain and faithful glass / Reflecting Matter and mortality, / And know thy soul a product of the flesh, / A made-up self in a constructed world.

10.03_142:036 - Thy words are large murmurs in a mystic dream.

10.03_142:037 - For how in the soiled heart of man could dwell / The inarticulate grandeur of thy dream-built God, / Or who can see a face and form divine / In the naked two-legged worm thou callest man?

10.03_142:038 - O human face, put off mind-painted masks: / The animal be, the worm that Nature meant; / Accept thy futile birth, thy narrow life.

10.03_142:039 - For truth is bare like stone and hard like death; / Bare in the bareness, hard with truth’s hardness live."

10.03_142:040 - But Savitri replied to the dire God: / “Yes, I am human. Yet shall man by me, / Since in humanity waits his hour the God, / Trample thee down to reach the immortal heights, / Transcending grief and pain and fate and death.

10.03_142:041 - Yes, my humanity is a mask of God: / He dwells in me, the mover of my acts, / Turning the great wheel of his cosmic work.

10.03_142:042 - I am the living body of his light, / I am the thinking instrument of his power, / I incarnate Wisdom in an earthly breast, / I am his conquering and unslayable Will.

10.03_142:043 - The formless Spirit drew in me its shape; / In me are the Nameless and the secret Name."

10.03_142:044 - Death from the incredulous Darkness sent its cry: / “O priestess in Imagination’s house, / Persuade first Nature’s fixed immutable laws / And make the impossible thy daily work.

10.03_142:045 - How canst thou force to wed two eternal foes?

10.03_142:046 - Irreconcilable in their embrace / They cancel the glory of their pure extremes: / An unhappy wedlock maims their stunted force.

10.03_142:047 - How shall thy will make one the true and false?

10.03_142:048 - Where Matter is all, there Spirit is a dream: / If all are the Spirit, Matter is a lie, / And who was the liar who forged the universe?

10.03_142:049 - The Real with the unreal cannot mate.

10.03_142:050 - He who would turn to God must leave the world; / He who would live in the Spirit, must give up life; / He who has met the Self, renounces self.

10.03_142:051 - The voyagers of the million routes of mind / Who have travelled through Existence to its end, / Sages exploring the world-ocean’s vasts, / Have found extinction the sole harbour safe.

10.03_142:052 - Two only are the doors of man’s escape, / Death of his body Matter’s gate to peace, / Death of his soul his last felicity.

10.03_142:053 - In me all take refuge, for I, Death, am God."

10.03_142:054 - But Savitri replied to mighty Death: / “My heart is wiser than the Reason’s thoughts, / My heart is stronger than thy bonds, O Death.

10.03_142:055 - It sees and feels the one Heart beat in all, / It feels the high Transcendent’s sunlike hands, / It sees the cosmic Spirit at its work; / In the dim Night it lies alone with God.

10.03_142:056 - My heart’s strength can carry the grief of the universe / And never falter from its luminous track, / Its white tremendous orbit through God’s peace.

10.03_142:057 - It can drink up the sea of All-Delight / And never lose the white spiritual touch, / The calm that broods in the deep Infinite."

10.03_142:058 - He said, “Art thou indeed so strong, O heart, / O soul, so free? And canst thou gather then / Bright pleasure from my wayside flowering boughs, / Yet falter not from thy hard journey’s goal, / Meet the world’s dangerous touch and never fall?

10.03_142:059 - Show me thy strength and freedom from my laws."

10.03_142:060 - But Savitri answered, “Surely I shall find / Among the green and whispering woods of Life / Close-bosomed pleasures, only mine since his, / Or mine for him, because our joys are one.

10.03_142:061 - And if I linger, Time is ours and God’s, / And if I fall, is not his hand near mine?

10.03_142:062 - All is a single plan; each wayside act / Deepens the soul’s response, brings nearer the goal."

10.03_142:063 - Death the contemptuous Nihil answered her: / “So prove thy absolute force to the wise gods, / By choosing earthly joy! For self demand / And yet from self and its gross masks live free.

10.03_142:064 - Then will I give thee all thy soul desires, / All the brief joys earth keeps for mortal hearts.

10.03_142:065 - Only the one dearest wish that outweighs all, / Hard laws forbid and thy ironic Fate.

10.03_142:066 - My will once wrought remains unchanged through Time, / And Satyavan can never again be thine."

10.03_142:067 - But Savitri replied to the vague Power: / “If the eyes of Darkness can look straight at Truth, / Look at my heart and, knowing what I am, / Give what thou wilt or what thou must, O Death.

10.03_142:068 - Nothing I claim but Satyavan alone."

10.03_142:069 - There was a hush as if of doubtful fates.

10.03_142:070 - As one disdainful still who yields a point, / Death bowed his sovereign head in cold assent: / “I give to thee, saved from death and poignant fate / Whatever once the living Satyavan / Desired in his heart for Savitri.

10.03_142:071 - Bright noons I give thee and unwounded dawns, / Daughters of thy own shape in heart and mind, / Fair hero sons and sweetness undisturbed / Of union with thy husband dear and true.

10.03_142:072 - And thou shalt harvest in thy joyful house / Felicity of thy surrounded eves.

10.03_142:073 - Love shall bind by thee many gathered hearts.

10.03_142:074 - The opposite sweetness in thy days shall meet / Of tender service to thy life’s desired / And loving empire over all thy loved, / Two poles of bliss made one, O Savitri.

10.03_142:075 - Return, O child, to thy forsaken earth."

10.03_142:076 - But Savitri replied, “Thy gifts resist.

10.03_142:077 - Earth cannot flower if lonely I return."

10.03_142:078 - Then Death once more sent forth his angry cry, / As chides a lion his escaping prey: / “What knowst thou of earth’s rich and changing life / Who thinkst that, one man dead, all joy must cease?

10.03_142:079 - Hope not to be unhappy till the end: / For grief dies soon in the tired human heart; / Soon other guests the empty chambers fill.

10.03_142:080 - Transient painting on a holiday’s floor / Traced for a moment’s beauty love was made.

10.03_142:081 - Or if a voyager on the eternal trail, / Its objects fluent change in its embrace / Like waves to a swimmer upon infinite seas."

10.03_142:082 - But Savitri replied to the vague God, / “Give me back Satyavan, my only Lord.

10.03_142:083 - Thy thoughts are vacant to my soul that feels / The deep eternal truth in transient things."

10.03_142:084 - Death answered her, “Return and try thy soul!

10.03_142:085 - Soon shalt thou find appeased that other men / On lavish earth have beauty, strength and truth, / And when thou hast half forgotten, one of these / Shall wind himself around thy heart that needs / Some human answering heart against thy breast; / For who, being mortal, can dwell glad alone?

10.03_142:086 - Then Satyavan shall glide into the past, / A gentle memory pushed away from thee / By new love and thy children’s tender hands, / Till thou shalt wonder if thou lov’dst at all.

10.03_142:087 - Such is the life earth’s travail has conceived, / A constant stream that never is the same."

10.03_142:088 - But Savitri replied to mighty Death: / “O dark ironic critic of God’s work, / Thou mockst the mind and body’s faltering search / For what the heart holds in a prophet hour / And the immortal spirit shall make its own.

10.03_142:089 - Mine is a heart that worshipped, though forsaken, / The image of the god its love adored; / I have burned in flame to travel in his steps.

10.03_142:090 - Are we not they who bore vast solitude / Seated upon the hills alone with God?

10.03_142:091 - Why dost thou vainly strive with me, O Death, / A mind delivered from all twilight thoughts, / To whom the secrets of the gods are plain?

10.03_142:092 - For now at last I know beyond all doubt, / The great stars burn with my unceasing fire / And life and death are both its fuel made.

10.03_142:093 - Life only was my blind attempt to love: / Earth saw my struggle, heaven my victory; / All shall be seized, transcended; there shall kiss / Casting their veils before the marriage fire / The eternal bridegroom and eternal bride.

10.03_142:094 - The heavens accept our broken flights at last.

10.03_142:095 - On our life’s prow that breaks the waves of Time / No signal light of hope has gleamed in vain."

10.03_142:096 - She spoke; the boundless members of the god / As if by secret ecstasy assailed / Shuddered in silence as obscurely stir / Ocean’s dim fields delivered to the moon.

10.03_142:097 - Then lifted up as by a sudden wind / Around her in that vague and glimmering world / The twilight trembled like a bursting veil.

10.03_142:098 - Thus with armed speech the great opponents strove.

10.03_142:099 - Around those spirits in the glittering mist / A deepening half-light fled with pearly wings / As if to reach some far ideal Morn.

10.03_142:100 - Outlined her thoughts flew through the gleaming haze / Mingling bright-pinioned with its lights and veils / And all her words like dazzling jewels caught / Into the glow of a mysterious world / Or tricked in the rainbow shifting of its hues / Like echoes swam fainting into far sound.

10.03_142:101 - All utterance, all mood must there become / An unenduring tissue sewn by mind / To make a gossamer robe of beautiful change.

10.03_142:102 - Intent upon her silent will she walked / On the dim grass of vague unreal plains, / A floating veil of visions in her front, / A trailing robe of dreams behind her feet.

10.03_142:103 - But now her spirit’s flame of conscient force / Retiring from a sweetness without fruit / Called back her thoughts from speech to sit within / In a deep room in meditation’s house.

10.03_142:104 - For only there could dwell the soul’s firm truth: / Imperishable, a tongue of sacrifice, / It flamed unquenched upon the central hearth / Where burns for the high house-lord and his mate / The homestead’s sentinel and witness fire / From which the altars of the gods are lit.

10.03_142:105 - All still compelled went gliding on unchanged, / Still was the order of these worlds reversed: / The mortal led, the god and spirit obeyed / And she behind was leader of their march / And they in front were followers of her will.

10.03_142:106 - Onward they journeyed through the drifting ways / Vaguely companioned by the glimmering mists; / But faster now all fled as if perturbed / Escaping from the clearness of her soul.

10.03_142:107 - A heaven bird upon jewelled wings of wind / Borne like a coloured and embosomed fire, / By spirits carried in a pearl-hued cave, / On through the enchanted dimness moved her soul.

10.03_142:108 - Death walked in front of her and Satyavan, / In the dark front of death, a failing star.

10.03_142:109 - Above was the unseen balance of his fate.


Canto 4 - 10.4: The Dream Twilight of the Earthly Real

Section I - 143: fruitless cycles


10.04_143:001 - There came a slope that slowly downward sank; / It slipped towards a stumbling grey descent.

10.04_143:002 - The dim-heart marvel of the ideal was lost; / Its crowding wonder of bright delicate dreams / And vague half-limned sublimities she had left: / Thought fell towards lower levels; hard and tense / It passioned for some crude reality.

10.04_143:003 - The twilight floated still but changed its hues / And heavily swathed a less delightful dream; / It settled in tired masses on the air; / Its symbol colours tuned with duller reds / And almost seemed a lurid mist of day.

10.04_143:004 - A straining taut and dire besieged her heart; / Heavy her sense grew with a dangerous load, / And sadder, greater sounds were in her ears, / And through stern breakings of the lambent glare / Her vision caught a hurry of driving plains / And cloudy mountains and wide tawny streams, / And cities climbed in minarets and towers / Towards an unavailing changeless sky: / Long quays and ghauts and harbours white with sails / Challenged her sight awhile and then were gone.

10.04_143:005 - Amidst them travailed toiling multitudes / In ever shifting perishable groups, / A foiled cinema of lit shadowy shapes / Enveloped in the grey mantle of a dream.

10.04_143:006 - Imagining meanings in life’s heavy drift, / They trusted in the uncertain environment / And waited for death to change their spirit’s scene.

10.04_143:007 - A savage din of labour and a tramp / Of armoured life and the monotonous hum / Of thoughts and acts that ever were the same, / As if the dull reiterated drone / Of a great brute machine, beset her soul,— / A grey dissatisfied rumour like a ghost / Of the moaning of a loud unquiet sea.

10.04_143:008 - A huge inhuman Cyclopean voice, / A Babel-builder’s song towering to heaven, / A throb of engines and the clang of tools / Brought the deep undertone of labour’s pain.

10.04_143:009 - As when pale lightnings tear a tortured sky, / High overhead a cloud-rimmed series flared / Chasing like smoke from a red funnel driven, / The forced creations of an ignorant Mind: / Drifting she saw like pictured fragments flee / Phantoms of human thought and baffled hopes, / The shapes of Nature and the arts of man, / Philosophies and disciplines and laws, / And the dead spirit of old societies, / Constructions of the Titan and the worm.

10.04_143:010 - As if lost remnants of forgotten light, / Before her mind there fled with trailing wings / Dimmed revelations and delivering words, / Emptied of their mission and their strength to save, / The messages of the evangelist gods, / Voices of prophets, scripts of vanishing creeds.

10.04_143:011 - Each in its hour eternal claimed went by: / Ideals, systems, sciences, poems, crafts / Tireless there perished and again recurred, / Sought restlessly by some creative Power.

10.04_143:012 - But all were dreams crossing an empty vast.

10.04_143:013 - Ascetic voices called of lonely seers / On mountain summits or on river banks / Or from the desolate heart of forest glades / Seeking heaven’s rest or the spirit’s worldless peace, / Or in bodies motionless like statues, fixed / In tranced cessations of their sleepless thought / Sat sleeping souls, and this too was a dream.

10.04_143:014 - All things the past has made and slain were there, / Its lost forgotten forms that once had lived, / And all the present loves as new-revealed / And all the hopes the future brings had failed / Already, caught and spent in efforts vain, / Repeated fruitlessly age after age.

10.04_143:015 - Unwearied all returned insisting still / Because of joy in the anguish of pursuit / And joy to labour and to win and lose / And joy to create and keep and joy to kill.

10.04_143:016 - The rolling cycles passed and came again, / Brought the same toils and the same barren end, / Forms ever new and ever old, the long / Appalling revolutions of the world.


Section I - 144: must the sage deny the Light


10.04_144:001 - Once more arose the great destroying Voice: / Across the fruitless labour of the worlds / His huge denial’s all-defeating might / Pursued the ignorant march of dolorous Time.

10.04_144:002 - “Behold the figures of this symbol realm, / Its solid outlines of creative dream / Inspiring the great concrete tasks of earth.

10.04_144:003 - In its motion parable of human life / Here thou canst trace the outcome Nature gives / To the sin of being and the error in things / And the desire that compels to live / And man’s incurable malady of hope.

10.04_144:004 - In an immutable order’s hierarchy / Where Nature changes not, man cannot change: / Ever he obeys her fixed mutation’s law; / In a new version of her oft-told tale / In ever-wheeling cycles turns the race.

10.04_144:005 - His mind is pent in circling boundaries: / For mind is man, beyond thought he cannot soar.

10.04_144:006 - If he could leave his limits he would be safe: / He sees but cannot mount to his greater heavens; / Even winged, he sinks back to his native soil.

10.04_144:007 - He is a captive in his net of mind / And beats soul-wings against the walls of life.

10.04_144:008 - In vain his heart lifts up its yearning prayer, / Peopling with brilliant Gods the formless Void; / Then disappointed to the Void he turns / And in its happy nothingness asks release, / The calm Nirvana of his dream of self: / The Word in silence ends, in Nought the name.

10.04_144:009 - Apart amid the mortal multitudes, / He calls the Godhead incommunicable / To be the lover of his lonely soul / Or casts his spirit into its void embrace, / Or he finds his copy in the impartial All; / He imparts to the Immobile his own will, / Attributes to the Eternal wrath and love / And to the Ineffable lends a thousand names.

10.04_144:010 - Hope not to call God down into his life: / How shalt thou bring the Everlasting here?

10.04_144:011 - There is no house for him in hurrying Time.

10.04_144:012 - Vainly thou seek’st in Matter’s world an aim; / No aim is there, only a will to be.

10.04_144:013 - All walk by Nature bound for ever the same.

10.04_144:014 - Look on these forms that stay awhile and pass, / These lives that long and strive, then are no more, / These structures that have no abiding truth, / The saviour creeds that cannot save themselves, / But perish in the strangling hands of the years, / Discarded from man’s thought, proved false by Time, / Philosophies that strip all problems bare / But nothing ever have solved since earth began, / And sciences omnipotent in vain / By which men learn of what the suns are made, / Transform all forms to serve their outward needs, / Ride through the sky and sail beneath the sea, / But learn not what they are or why they came; / These polities, architectures of man’s brain, / That, bricked with evil and good, wall in man’s spirit / And, fissured houses, palace at once and jail, / Rot while they reign and crumble before they crash; / These revolutions, demon or drunken god, / Convulsing the wounded body of mankind / Only to paint in new colours an old face; / These wars, carnage triumphant, ruin gone mad, / The work of centuries vanishing in an hour, / The blood of the vanquished and the victor’s crown / Which men to be born must pay for with their pain, / The hero’s face divine on satyr’s limbs, / The demon’s grandeur mixed with the demi-god’s, / The glory and the beasthood and the shame; / Why is it all, the labour and the din, / The transient joys, the timeless sea of tears, / The longing and the hoping and the cry, / The battle and the victory and the fall, / The aimless journey that can never pause, / The waking toil, the incoherent sleep?

10.04_144:015 - Song, shouts and weeping, wisdom and idle words, / The laughter of men, the irony of the gods?

10.04_144:016 - Where leads the march, whither the pilgrimage?

10.04_144:017 - Who keeps the map of the route or planned each stage?

10.04_144:018 - Or else self-moved the world walks its own way?

10.04_144:019 - Or nothing is there but only a Mind that dreams: / The world is a myth that happened to come true, / A legend told to itself by conscious Mind, / Imaged and played on a feigned Matter’s ground / On which it stands in an unsubstantial Vast.

10.04_144:020 - Mind is the author, spectator, actor, stage: / Mind only is and what it thinks is seen.

10.04_144:021 - If Mind is all, renounce the hope of bliss; / If Mind is all, renounce the hope of Truth.

10.04_144:022 - For Mind can never touch the body of Truth / And Mind can never see the soul of God; / Only his shadow it grasps nor hears his laugh / As it turns from him to the vain seeming of things.

10.04_144:023 - Mind is a tissue woven of light and shade / Where right and wrong have sewn their mingled parts; / Or Mind is Nature’s marriage of covenance / Between truth and falsehood, between joy and pain: / This struggling pair no court can separate.

10.04_144:024 - Each thought is a gold coin with bright alloy / And error and truth are its obverse and reverse: / This is the imperial mintage of the brain / And of this kind is all its currency.

10.04_144:025 - Think not to plant on earth the living Truth / Or make of Matter’s world the home of God; / Truth comes not there but only the thought of Truth, / God is not there but only the name of God.

10.04_144:026 - If Self there is, it is bodiless and unborn; / It is no one and it is possessed by none, / On what shalt thou then build thy happy world?

10.04_144:027 - Cast off thy life and mind, then art thou Self, / An all-seeing Omnipresence stark, alone, / If God there is he cares not for the world; / All things he sees with calm indifferent gaze, / He has doomed all hearts to sorrow and desire, / He has bound all life with his implacable laws; / He answers not the ignorant voice of prayer.

10.04_144:028 - Eternal while the ages toil beneath, / Unmoved, untouched by aught that he has made, / He sees as minute details mid the stars / The animal’s agony and the fate of man: / Immeasurably wise, he exceeds thy thought; / His solitary joy needs not thy love.

10.04_144:029 - His truth in human thinking cannot dwell: / If thou desirest truth then still thy mind / For ever, slain by the dumb unseen Light.

10.04_144:030 - Immortal bliss lives not in human air: / How shall the mighty Mother her calm delight / Keep fragrant in this narrow fragile vase / Or lodge her sweet unbroken ecstasy / In hearts which earthly sorrow can assail / And bodies careless Death can slay at will?

10.04_144:031 - Dream not to change the world that God has planned, / Strive not to alter his eternal law.

10.04_144:032 - If heavens there are whose gates are shut to grief, / There seek the joy thou couldst not find on earth; / Or in the imperishable hemisphere / Where Light is native and Delight is king / And Spirit is the deathless ground of Things, / Choose thy high station, child of Eternity.

10.04_144:033 - If thou art Spirit and Nature is thy robe, / Cast off thy garb and be thy naked self / Immutable in its undying truth, / Alone for ever in the mute Alone.

10.04_144:034 - Turn then to God, for him leave all behind; / Forgetting Love, forgetting Satyavan, / Annul thyself in his immobile peace.

10.04_144:035 - O soul, drown in his still beatitude.

10.04_144:036 - For thou must die to thyself to reach God’s height: / I, Death, am the gate of immortality."

10.04_144:037 - But Savitri answered to the sophist God: / “Once more wilt thou call Light to blind Truth’s eyes, / Make knowledge a catch of the snare of Ignorance / And the Word a dart to slay my living Soul?

10.04_144:038 - Offer, O king, thy boons to tired spirits / And hearts that could not bear the wounds of Time, / Let those who were tied to body and to mind, / Tear off those bonds and flee into white calm / Crying for a refuge from the play of God, / Surely thy boons are great since thou art He!

10.04_144:039 - But how shall I seek rest in endless peace / Who house the mighty Mother’s violent force, / Her vision turned to read the enigmaed world, / Her will tempered in the blaze of Wisdom’s sun / And the flaming silence of her heart of love?

10.04_144:040 - The world is a spiritual paradox / Invented by a need in the Unseen, / A poor translation to the creature’s sense / Of That which for ever exceeds idea and speech, / A symbol of what can never be symbolised, / A language mispronounced, misspelt, yet true.

10.04_144:041 - Its powers have come from the eternal heights / And plunged into the inconscient dim Abyss / And risen from it to do their marvellous work.

10.04_144:042 - The soul is a figure of the Unmanifest, / The mind labours to think the Unthinkable, / The life to call the Immortal into birth, / The body to enshrine the Illimitable.

10.04_144:043 - The world is not cut off from Truth and God.

10.04_144:044 - In vain thou hast dug the dark unbridgeable gulf, / In vain thou hast built the blind and doorless wall: / Man’s soul crosses through thee to Paradise, / Heaven’s sun forces its way through death and night; / Its light is seen upon our being’s verge.

10.04_144:045 - My mind is a torch lit from the eternal sun, / My life a breath drawn by the immortal Guest, / My mortal body is the Eternal’s house.

10.04_144:046 - Already the torch becomes the undying ray, / Already the life is the Immortal’s force, / The house grows of the householder part and one.

10.04_144:047 - How sayst thou Truth can never light the human mind / And Bliss can never invade the mortal’s heart / Or God descend into the world he made?

10.04_144:048 - If in the meaningless Void creation rose, / If from a bodiless Force Matter was born, / If Life could climb in the unconscious tree, / If green delight break into emerald leaves / And its laughter of beauty blossom in the flower, / If sense could wake in tissue, nerve and cell, / And Thought seize the grey matter of the brain, / And soul peep from its secrecy through the flesh, / How shall the nameless light not leap on men, / And unknown powers emerge from Nature’s sleep?

10.04_144:049 - Even now hints of a luminous Truth like stars / Arise in the mind-mooned splendour of Ignorance; / Even now the deathless Lover’s touch we feel: / If the chamber’s door is even a little ajar, / What then can hinder God from stealing in / Or who forbid his kiss on the sleeping soul?

10.04_144:050 - Already God is near, the Truth is close: / Because the dark atheist body knows him not, / Must the sage deny the Light, the seer his soul?

10.04_144:051 - I am not bound by thought or sense or shape; / I live in the glory of the Infinite, / I am near to the Nameless and Unknowable, / The Ineffable is now my household mate.

10.04_144:052 - But standing on Eternity’s luminous brink / I have discovered that the world was He; / I have met Spirit with spirit, Self with self, / But I have loved too the body of my God.

10.04_144:053 - I have pursued him in his earthly form.

10.04_144:054 - A lonely freedom cannot satisfy / A heart that has grown one with every heart: / I am a deputy of the aspiring world, / My spirit’s liberty I ask for all."


Section I - 145: how all shakes when God comes too near


10.04_145:001 - Then rang again a deeper cry of Death.

10.04_145:002 - As if beneath its weight of sterile law / Oppressed by its own obstinate meaningless will, / Disdainful, weary and compassionate, / It kept no more its old intolerant sound, / But seemed like life’s in her unnumbered paths, / Toiling for ever and achieving nought / Because of birth and change, her mortal powers / By which she lasts, around the term posts fixed / Turning of a wide circling aimless race / Whose course for ever speeds and is the same.

10.04_145:003 - In its long play with Fate and Chance and Time / Assured of the game’s vanity lost or won, / Crushed by its load of ignorance and doubt / Which knowledge seems to increase and growth to enlarge, / The earth-mind sinks and it despairs and looks / Old, weary and discouraged on its work.

10.04_145:004 - Yet was all nothing then or vainly achieved?

10.04_145:005 - Some great thing has been done, some light, some power / Delivered from the huge Inconscient’s grasp: / It has emerged from night; it sees its dawns / Circling for ever though no dawn can stay.

10.04_145:006 - This change was in the godhead’s far-flung voice; / His form of dread was altered and admitted / Our transient effort at eternity, / Yet flung vast doubts of what might else have been / On grandiose hints of an impossible day.

10.04_145:007 - The great voice surging cried to Savitri: / “Because thou knowst the wisdom that transcends / Both veil of forms and the contempt of forms, / Arise delivered by the seeing gods.

10.04_145:008 - If free thou hadst kept thy mind from life’s fierce stress, / Thou mightst have been like them omniscient, calm.

10.04_145:009 - But the violent and passionate heart forbids.

10.04_145:010 - It is the storm bird of an anarch Power / That would upheave the world and tear from it / The indecipherable scroll of Fate, / Death’s rule and Law and the unknowable Will.

10.04_145:011 - Hasteners to action, violators of God / Are these great spirits who have too much love, / And they who formed like thee, for both art thou, / Have come into the narrow bounds of life / With too large natures overleaping time.

10.04_145:012 - Worshippers of force who know not her recoil, / Their giant wills compel the troubled years.

10.04_145:013 - The wise are tranquil; silent the great hills / Rise ceaselessly towards their unreached sky, / Seated on their unchanging base, their heads / Dreamless in heaven’s immutable domain.

10.04_145:014 - On their aspiring tops, sublime and still, / Lifting half-way to heaven the climbing soul / The mighty mediators stand content / To watch the revolutions of the stars.

10.04_145:015 - Motionlessly moving with the might of earth, / They see the ages pass and are the same.

10.04_145:016 - The wise think with the cycles, they hear the tread / Of far-off things; patient, unmoved they keep / Their dangerous wisdom in their depths restrained, / Lest man’s frail days into the unknown should sink / Dragged like a ship by bound leviathan / Into the abyss of his stupendous seas.

10.04_145:017 - Lo, how all shakes when the gods tread too near!

10.04_145:018 - All moves, is in peril, anguished, torn, upheaved.

10.04_145:019 - The hurrying aeons would stumble on too swift / If strength from heaven surprised the imperfect earth / And veilless knowledge smote these unfit souls.

10.04_145:020 - The deities have screened their dreadful power: / God hides his thought and, even, he seems to err.

10.04_145:021 - Be still and tardy in the slow wise world.

10.04_145:022 - Mighty art thou with the dread goddess filled, / To whom thou criedst at dawn in the dim woods.

10.04_145:023 - Use not thy strength like the wild Titan souls!

10.04_145:024 - Touch not the seated lines, the ancient laws, / Respect the calm of great established things."

10.04_145:025 - But Savitri replied to the huge god: / “What is the calm thou vauntst, O Law, O Death?

10.04_145:026 - Is it not the dull-visioned tread inert / Of monstrous energies chained in a stark round / Soulless and stone-eyed with mechanic dreams?

10.04_145:027 - Vain the soul’s hope if changeless Law is all: / Ever to the new and the unknown press on / The speeding aeons justifying God.

10.04_145:028 - What were earth’s ages if the grey restraint / Were never broken and glories sprang not forth / Bursting their obscure seed, while man’s slow life / Leaped hurried into sudden splendid paths / By divine words and human gods revealed?

10.04_145:029 - Impose not upon sentient minds and hearts / The dull fixity that binds inanimate things.

10.04_145:030 - Well is the unconscious rule for the animal breeds / Content to live beneath the immutable yoke; / Man turns to a nobler walk, a master path.

10.04_145:031 - I trample on thy law with living feet; / For to arise in freedom I was born.

10.04_145:032 - If I am mighty let my force be unveiled / Equal companion of the dateless powers, / Or else let my frustrated soul sink down / Unworthy of Godhead in the original sleep.

10.04_145:033 - I claim from Time my will’s eternity, / God from his moments.“ Death replied to her, / “Why should the noble and immortal will / Stoop to the petty works of transient earth, / Freedom forgotten and the Eternal’s path?

10.04_145:034 - Or is this the high use of strength and thought, / To struggle with the bonds of death and time / And spend the labour that might earn the gods / And battle and bear agony of wounds / To grasp the trivial joys that earth can guard / In her small treasure-chest of passing things?

10.04_145:035 - Child, hast thou trodden the gods beneath thy feet / Only to win poor shreds of earthly life / For him thou lov’st cancelling the grand release, / Keeping from early rapture of the heavens / His soul the lenient deities have called?

10.04_145:036 - Are thy arms sweeter than the courts of God?"

10.04_145:037 - She answered, “Straight I trample on the road / The strong hand hewed for me which planned our paths.

10.04_145:038 - I run where his sweet dreadful voice commands / And I am driven by the reins of God.

10.04_145:039 - Why drew he wide his scheme of mighty worlds / Or filled infinity with his passionate breath?

10.04_145:040 - Or wherefore did he build my mortal form / And sow in me his bright and proud desires, / If not to achieve, to flower in me, to love, / Carving his human image richly shaped / In thoughts and largenesses and golden powers?

10.04_145:041 - Far Heaven can wait our coming in its calm.

10.04_145:042 - Easy the heavens were to build for God.

10.04_145:043 - Earth was his difficult matter, earth the glory / Gave of the problem and the race and strife.

10.04_145:044 - There are the ominous masks, the terrible powers; / There it is greatness to create the gods.

10.04_145:045 - Is not the spirit immortal and absolved / Always, delivered from the grasp of Time?

10.04_145:046 - Why came it down into the mortal’s Space?

10.04_145:047 - A charge he gave to his high spirit in man / And wrote a hidden decree on Nature’s tops.

10.04_145:048 - Freedom is this with ever seated soul, / Large in life’s limits, strong in Matter’s knots, / Building great stuff of action from the worlds / To make fine wisdom from coarse scattered strands / And love and beauty out of war and night, / The wager wonderful, the game divine.

10.04_145:049 - What liberty has the soul which feels not free / Unless stripped bare and cannot kiss the bonds / The Lover winds around his playmate’s limbs, / Choosing his tyranny, crushed in his embrace?

10.04_145:050 - To seize him better with her boundless heart / She accepts the limiting circle of his arms, / Bows full of bliss beneath his mastering hands / And laughs in his rich constraints, most bound, most free.

10.04_145:051 - This is my answer to thy lures, O Death."


Section I - 146: In the realms of the Immortal Supermind


10.04_146:001 - Immutable, Death’s denial met her cry: / “However mighty, whatever thy secret name / Uttered in hidden conclaves of the gods, / Thy heart’s ephemeral passion cannot break / The iron rampart of accomplished things / With which the great Gods fence their camp in Space.

10.04_146:002 - Whoever thou art behind thy human mask, / Even if thou art the Mother of the worlds / And pegg’st thy claim upon the realms of Chance, / The cosmic Law is greater than thy will.

10.04_146:003 - Even God himself obeys the Laws he made: / The Law abides and never can it change, / The Person is a bubble on Time’s sea.

10.04_146:004 - A forerunner of a greater Truth to come, / Thy soul creator of its freer Law, / Vaunting a Force behind on which it leans, / A Light above which none but thou hast seen, / Thou claimst the first fruits of Truth’s victory.

10.04_146:005 - But what is Truth and who can find her form / Amid the specious images of sense, / Amid the crowding guesses of the mind / And the dark ambiguities of a world / Peopled with the incertitudes of Thought?

10.04_146:006 - For where is Truth and when was her footfall heard / Amid the endless clamour of Time’s mart / And which is her voice amid the thousand cries / That cross the listening brain and cheat the soul?

10.04_146:007 - Or is Truth aught but a high starry name, / Or a vague and splendid word by which man’s thought / Sanctions and consecrates his nature’s choice, / The heart’s wish donning knowledge as its robe, / The cherished idea elect among the elect, / Thought’s favourite mid the children of half-light / Who high-voiced crowd the playgrounds of the mind / Or people its dormitories in infant sleep?

10.04_146:008 - All things hang here between God’s yes and no, / Two Powers real but to each other untrue, / Two consort stars in the mooned night of mind / That towards two opposite horizons gaze, / The white head and black tail of the mystic drake, / The swift and the lame foot, wing strong, wing broken / Sustaining the body of the uncertain world, / A great surreal dragon in the skies.

10.04_146:009 - Too dangerously thy high proud truth must live / Entangled in Matter’s mortal littleness.

10.04_146:010 - All in this world is true, yet all is false: / Its thoughts into an eternal cipher run, / Its deeds swell to Time’s rounded zero sum.

10.04_146:011 - Thus man at once is animal and god, / A disparate enigma of God’s mate / Unable to free the Godhead’s form within, / A being less than himself, yet something more, / The aspiring animal, the frustrate god, / Yet neither beast nor deity but man, / But man tied to the kind earth’s labour strives to exceed, / Climbing the stairs of God to higher Things.

10.04_146:012 - Objects are seemings and none knows their truth, / Ideas are guesses of an ignorant god.

10.04_146:013 - Truth has no home in earth’s irrational breast: / Yet without reason life is a tangle of dreams, / But reason is poised above a dim abyss / And stands at last upon a plank of doubt.

10.04_146:014 - Eternal truth lives not with mortal men.

10.04_146:015 - Or if she dwells not within thy mortal heart, / Show me the body of the living Truth / Or draw for me the outline of her face / That I too may obey and worship her.

10.04_146:016 - Then will I give thee back thy Satyavan.

10.04_146:017 - But here are only facts and steel-bound Law.

10.04_146:018 - This truth I know that Satyavan is dead / And even thy sweetness cannot lure him back.

10.04_146:019 - No magic Truth can bring the dead to life, / No power of earth cancel the thing once done, / No joy of the heart can last surviving death, / No bliss persuade the past to live again.

10.04_146:020 - But Life alone can solace the mute Void / And fill with thought the emptiness of Time.

10.04_146:021 - Leave then thy dead, O Savitri, and live."

10.04_146:022 - The Woman answered to the mighty Shade, / And as she spoke, mortality disappeared; / Her Goddess self grew visible in her eyes, / Light came a dream of heaven into her face.

10.04_146:023 - “O Death, thou too art God and yet not He, / But only his own black shadow on his path / As leaving the Night he takes the upward Way / And drags with him its clinging inconscient Force.

10.04_146:024 - Of God unconscious thou art the dark head, / Of his Ignorance thou art the impenitent sign, / Of its vast tenebrous womb the natural child, / On his immortality the sinister bar.

10.04_146:025 - All contraries are aspects of God’s face.

10.04_146:026 - The Many are the innumerable One, / The One carries the multitude in his breast; / He is the Impersonal, inscrutable, sole, / He is the one infinite Person seeing his world; / The Silence bears the Eternal’s great dumb seal, / His light inspires the eternal Word; / He is the Immobile’s deep and deathless hush, / Its white and signless blank negating calm, / Yet stands the creator Self, the almighty Lord / And watches his will done by the forms of gods / And the desire that goads half-conscious man / And the reluctant and unseeing Night.

10.04_146:027 - These wide divine extremes, these inverse powers / Are the right and left side of the body of God; / Existence balanced twixt two mighty arms / Confronts the mind with unsolved abysms of Thought.

10.04_146:028 - Darkness below, a fathomless Light above, / In Light are joined, but sundered by severing Mind / Stand face to face, opposite, inseparable, / Two contraries needed for his great World-task, / Two poles whose currents wake the immense World-Force.

10.04_146:029 - In the stupendous secrecy of his Self, / Above the world brooding with equal wings, / He is both in one beginningless, without end: / Transcending both, he enters the Absolute.

10.04_146:030 - His being is a mystery beyond mind, / His ways bewilder mortal ignorance; / The finite in its little sections parked, / Amazed, credits not God’s audacity / Who dares to be the unimagined All / And see and act as might one Infinite.

10.04_146:031 - Against human reason this is his offence; / Being known to be for ever unknowable, / To be all and yet transcend the mystic whole, / Absolute, to lodge in a relative world of Time, / Eternal and all-knowing, to suffer birth, / Omnipotent, to sport with Chance and Fate, / Spirit, yet to be Matter and the Void, / Illimitable, beyond form or name / To dwell within a body, one and supreme / To be animal and human and divine: / A still deep sea, he laughs in rolling waves: / Universal, he is all,—transcendent, none.

10.04_146:032 - To man’s righteousness this is his cosmic crime, / Almighty beyond good and evil to dwell / Leaving the good to their fate in a wicked world / And evil to reign in this enormous scene.

10.04_146:033 - All opposition seems and strife and chance / An aimless labour with but scanty sense / To eyes that see a part and miss the whole; / The surface men scan, the depths refuse their search: / A hybrid mystery challenges the view, / Or a discouraging sordid miracle.

10.04_146:034 - Yet in the exact Inconscient’s stark conceit, / In the casual error of the world’s ignorance / A plan, a hidden Intelligence is glimpsed.

10.04_146:035 - There is a purpose in each stumble and fall; / Nature’s most careless lolling is a pose / Preparing some forward step, some deep result.

10.04_146:036 - Ingenious notes plugged into a motived score, / These million discords dot the harmonious theme / Of the evolution’s huge orchestral dance.

10.04_146:037 - A Truth supreme has forced the world to be; / It has wrapped itself in Matter as in a shroud, / A shroud of Death, a shroud of Ignorance.

10.04_146:038 - It compelled the suns to burn through silent Space, / Flame-signs of its uncomprehended Thought / In a wide brooding ether’s formless muse: / It made of Knowledge a veiled and struggling light, / Of Being a substance nescient, dense and dumb, / Of Bliss the beauty of an insentient world.

10.04_146:039 - In finite things the conscious Infinite dwells: / Involved it sleeps in Matter’s helpless trance, / It rules the world from its sleeping senseless Void; / Dreaming it throws out mind and heart and soul / To labour crippled, bound, on the hard earth; / A broken whole it works through scattered points; / Its gleaming shards are Wisdom’s diamond thoughts, / Its shadowy reflex our ignorance.

10.04_146:040 - It starts from the mute mass in countless jets, / It fashions a being out of brain and nerve, / A sentient creature from its pleasures and pangs.

10.04_146:041 - A pack of feelings obscure, a dot of sense / Survives awhile answering the shocks of life, / Then crushed or, its force spent, leaves the dead form, / Leaves the huge universe in which it lived / An insignificant unconsidered guest.

10.04_146:042 - But the soul grows concealed within its house; / It gives to the body its strength and magnificence; / It follows aims in an ignorant aimless world, / It lends significance to earth’s meaningless life.

10.04_146:043 - A demi-god animal, came thinking man.

10.04_146:044 - He wallows in mud, yet heavenward soars in thought; / He plays and ponders, laughs and weeps and dreams, / Satisfies his little longings like the beast; / He pores upon life’s book with student eyes.

10.04_146:045 - Out of this tangle of intellect and sense, / Out of the narrow scope of finite thought / At last he wakes into spiritual mind; / A high liberty begins and luminous room: / He glimpses eternity, touches the infinite, / He meets the gods in great and sudden hours, / He feels the universe as his larger self, / Makes space and time his opportunity / To join the heights and depths of being in light, / In the heart’s cave speaks secretly with God.

10.04_146:046 - But these are touches and high moments lived; / Fragments of Truth supreme have lit his soul, / Reflections of the sun in waters still.

10.04_146:047 - A few have dared the last supreme ascent / And break through borders of blinding light above, / And feel a breath around of mightier air, / Receive a vaster being’s messages / And bathe in its immense intuitive Ray.

10.04_146:048 - On summit Mind are radiant altitudes / Exposed to the lustre of Infinity, / Outskirts and dependences of the house of Truth, / Upraised estates of Mind and measureless.

10.04_146:049 - There man can visit but there he cannot live.

10.04_146:050 - A cosmic Thought spreads out its vastitudes; / Its smallest parts are here philosophies / Challenging with their detailed immensity, / Each figuring an omniscient scheme of things.

10.04_146:051 - But higher still can climb the ascending light; / There are vasts of vision and eternal suns, / Oceans of an immortal luminousness, / Flame-hills assaulting heaven with their peaks, / There dwelling all becomes a blaze of sight; / A burning head of vision leads the mind, / Thought trails behind it its long comet tail; / The heart glows, an illuminate and seer, / And sense is kindled into identity.

10.04_146:052 - A highest flight climbs to a deepest view: / In a wide opening of its native sky / Intuition’s lightnings range in a bright pack / Hunting all hidden truths out of their lairs, / Its fiery edge of seeing absolute / Cleaves into locked unknown retreats of self, / Rummages the sky-recesses of the brain, / Lights up the occult chambers of the heart; / Its spear-point ictus of discovery / Pressed on the cover of name, the screen of form, / Strips bare the secret soul of all that is.

10.04_146:053 - Thought there has revelation’s sun-bright eyes; / The Word, a mighty and inspiring Voice, / Enters Truth’s inmost cabin of privacy / And tears away the veil from God and life.

10.04_146:054 - Then stretches the boundless finite’s last expanse, / The cosmic empire of the Overmind, / Time’s buffer state bordering Eternity, / Too vast for the experience of man’s soul: / All here gathers beneath one golden sky: / The Powers that build the cosmos station take / In its house of infinite possibility; / Each god from there builds his own nature’s world; / Ideas are phalanxed like a group of sums; / Thought crowds in masses seized by one regard; / All Time is one body, Space a single book: / There is the Godhead’s universal gaze / And there the boundaries of immortal Mind: / The line that parts and joins the hemispheres / Closes in on the labour of the Gods / Fencing eternity from the toil of Time.

10.04_146:055 - In her glorious kingdom of eternal light / All-ruler, ruled by none, the Truth supreme, / Omnipotent, omniscient and alone, / In a golden country keeps her measureless house; / In its corridor she hears the tread that comes / Out of the Unmanifest never to return / Till the Unknown is known and seen by men.

10.04_146:056 - Above the stretch and blaze of cosmic Sight, / Above the silence of the wordless Thought, / Formless creator of immortal forms, / Nameless, investitured with the name divine, / Transcending Time’s hours, transcending Timelessness, / The Mighty Mother sits in lucent calm / And holds the eternal Child upon her knees, / Attending the day when he shall speak to Fate.

10.04_146:057 - There is the image of our future’s hope; / There is the sun for which all darkness waits, / There is the imperishable harmony; / The world’s contradictions climb to her and are one: / There is the Truth of which the world’s truths are shreds, / The Light of which the world’s ignorance is the shade / Till Truth draws back the shade that it has cast, / The Love our hearts call down to heal all strife, / The Bliss for which the world’s derelict sorrows yearn: / Thence comes the glory sometimes seen on earth, / The visits of Godhead to the human soul, / The Beauty and the dream on Nature’s face.

10.04_146:058 - There the perfection born from eternity / Calls to it the perfection born in Time, / The truth of God surprising human life, / The image of God overtaking finite shapes.

10.04_146:059 - There is a world of everlasting Light, / In the realms of the immortal Supermind / Truth who hides here her head in mystery, / Her riddle deemed by reason impossible / In the stark structure of material form, / Unenigmaed lives, unmasked her face and there / Is Nature and the common law of things.

10.04_146:060 - There in a body made of spirit stuff, / The hearth-stone of the everlasting Fire, / Action translates the movements of the soul, / Thought steps infallible and absolute / And life is a continual worship’s rite, / A sacrifice of rapture to the One.

10.04_146:061 - A cosmic vision, a spiritual sense / Feels all the Infinite lodged in finite form / And seen through a quivering ecstasy of light / Discovers the bright face of the Bodiless, / In the truth of a moment, in the moment’s soul / Can sip the honey-wine of Eternity.

10.04_146:062 - A Spirit who is no one and innumerable, / The one mystic infinite Person of his world / Multiplies his myriad personality, / On all his bodies seals his divinity’s stamp / And sits in each immortal and unique.

10.04_146:063 - The Immobile stands behind each daily act, / A background of the movement and the scene, / Upholding creation on its might and calm / And change on the Immutable’s deathless poise.

10.04_146:064 - The Timeless looks out from the travelling hours; / The Ineffable puts on a robe of speech / Where all its words are woven like magic threads / Moving with beauty, inspiring with their gleam, / And every thought takes up its destined place / Recorded in the memory of the world.

10.04_146:065 - The Truth supreme, vast and impersonal / Fits faultlessly the hour and circumstance, / Its substance a pure gold ever the same / But shaped into vessels for the spirit’s use, / Its gold becomes the wine jar and the vase.

10.04_146:066 - All there is a supreme epiphany: / The All-Wonderful makes a marvel of each event, / The All-Beautiful is a miracle in each shape; / The All-Blissful smites with rapture the heart’s throbs, / A pure celestial joy is the use of sense.

10.04_146:067 - Each being there is a member of the Self, / A portion of the million-thoughted All, / A claimant to the timeless Unity, / The many’s sweetness, the joy of difference / Edged with the intimacy of the One.

10.04_146:068 - But who can show to thee Truth’s glorious face?

10.04_146:069 - Our human words can only shadow her.

10.04_146:070 - To thought she is an unthinkable rapture of light, / To speech a marvel inexpressible.

10.04_146:071 - O Death, if thou couldst touch the Truth supreme / Thou wouldst grow suddenly wise and cease to be.

10.04_146:072 - If our souls could see and love and clasp God’s Truth, / Its infinite radiance would seize our hearts, / Our being in God’s image be remade / And earthly life become the life divine."

10.04_146:073 - Then Death the last time answered Savitri: / “If Truth supreme transcends her shadow here / Severed by Knowledge and the climbing vasts, / What bridge can cross the gulf that she has left / Between her and the dream-world she has made?

10.04_146:074 - Or who could hope to bring her down to men / And persuade to tread the harsh globe with wounded feet, / Leaving her unapproachable glory and bliss, / Wasting her splendour on pale earthly air?

10.04_146:075 - Is thine that strength, O beauty of mortal limbs, / O soul who flutterest to escape my net?

10.04_146:076 - Who then art thou hiding in human guise?

10.04_146:077 - Thy voice carries the sound of infinity, / Knowledge is with thee, Truth speaks through thy words; / The light of things beyond shines in thy eyes.

10.04_146:078 - But where is thy strength to conquer Time and Death?

10.04_146:079 - Hast thou God’s force to build heaven’s values here?

10.04_146:080 - For truth and knowledge are an idle gleam, / If Knowledge brings not power to change the world, / If Might comes not to give to Truth her right.

10.04_146:081 - A blind Force, not Truth has made this ignorant world, / A blind Force, not Truth orders the lives of men: / By Power, not Light, the great Gods rule the world; / Power is the arm of God, the seal of Fate.

10.04_146:082 - O human claimant to immortality, / Reveal thy power, lay bare thy spirit’s force, / Then will I give back to thee Satyavan.

10.04_146:083 - Or if the Mighty Mother is with thee, / Show me her face that I may worship her; / Let deathless eyes look into the eyes of Death, / An imperishable Force touching brute things / Transform earth’s death into immortal life.

10.04_146:084 - Then can thy dead return to thee and live, / The prostrate earth perhaps shall lift her gaze / And feel near her the secret body of God / And love and joy overtake fleeing Time."



Section I - 147: And Darkness saw Gods living Reality


10.04_147:001 - And Savitri looked on Death and answered not.

10.04_147:002 - Almost it seemed as if in his symbol shape / The world’s darkness had consented to Heaven-light / And God needed no more the Inconscient’s screen.

10.04_147:003 - A mighty transformation came on her.

10.04_147:004 - A halo of the indwelling Deity, / The Immortal’s lustre that had lit her face / And tented its radiance in her body’s house, / Overflowing made the air a luminous sea.

10.04_147:005 - In a flaming moment of apocalypse / The Incarnation thrust aside its veil.

10.04_147:006 - A little figure in infinity / Yet stood and seemed the Eternal’s very house, / As if the world’s centre was her very soul / And all wide space was but its outer robe.

10.04_147:007 - A curve of the calm hauteur of far heaven / Descending into earth’s humility, / Her forehead’s span vaulted the Omniscient’s gaze, / Her eyes were two stars that watched the universe.

10.04_147:008 - The Power that from her being’s summit reigned, / The Presence chambered in lotus secrecy, / Came down and held the centre in her brow / Where the mind’s Lord in his control-room sits; / There throned on concentration’s native seat / He opens that third mysterious eye in man, / The Unseen’s eye that looks at the unseen, / When Light with a golden ecstasy fills his brain / And the Eternal’s wisdom drives his choice / And eternal Will seizes the mortal’s will.

10.04_147:009 - It stirred in the lotus of her throat of song, / And in her speech throbbed the immortal Word, / Her life sounded with the steps of the World-Soul / Moving in harmony with the cosmic Thought.

10.04_147:010 - As glides God’s sun into the mystic cave / Where hides his light from the pursuing gods, / It glided into the lotus of her heart / And woke in it the Force that alters Fate.

10.04_147:011 - It poured into a navel’s lotus depth, / Lodged in the little life-nature’s narrow home, / On the body’s longings grew heaven-rapture’s flower / And made desire a pure celestial flame, / Broke into the cave where coiled World-Energy sleeps / And smote the thousand-hooded serpent Force / That blazing towered and clasped the World-Self above, / Joined Matter’s dumbness to the Spirit’s hush / And filled earth’s acts with the Spirit’s silent power.

10.04_147:012 - Thus changed she waited for the Word to speak.

10.04_147:013 - Eternity looked into the eyes of Death.

10.04_147:014 - And Darkness saw God’s living Reality.

10.04_147:015 - Then a Voice was heard that seemed the stillness’ self / Or the low calm utterance of infinity / When it speaks to the silence in the heart of sleep.

10.04_147:016 - “I hail thee almighty and victorious Death, / Thou grandiose Darkness of the Infinite.

10.04_147:017 - O Void that makest room for all to be, / Hunger that gnawest at the universe / Consuming the cold remnants of the suns / And eat’st the whole world with thy jaws of fire, / Waster of the energy that has made the stars, / Inconscience, carrier of the seeds of thought, / Nescience in which All-Knowledge sleeps entombed / And slowly emerges in its hollow breast / Wearing the mind’s mask of bright Ignorance.

10.04_147:018 - Thou art my shadow and my instrument.

10.04_147:019 - I have given thee thy awful shape of dread / And thy sharp sword of terror and grief and pain / To force the soul of man to struggle for light / On the brevity of his half-conscious days.

10.04_147:020 - Thou art his spur to greatness in his works, / The whip to his yearning for eternal bliss, / His poignant need of immortality.

10.04_147:021 - Live, Death, awhile, be still my instrument.

10.04_147:022 - One day man too shall know thy fathomless heart / Of silence and the brooding peace of Night / And grave obedience to eternal Law / And the calm inflexible pity in thy gaze.

10.04_147:023 - But now, O timeless Mightiness, stand aside / And leave the path of my incarnate Force.

10.04_147:024 - Relieve the radiant god from thy black mask; / Release the soul of the world called Satyavan / Freed from thy clutch of pain and ignorance / That he may stand master of life and fate, / Man’s representative in the house of God, / The mate of Wisdom and the spouse of Light, / The eternal bridegroom of the eternal bride."

10.04_147:025 - She spoke; Death unconvinced resisted still, / Although he knew refusing still to know, / Although he saw refusing still to see.

10.04_147:026 - Unshakable he stood claiming his right.

10.04_147:027 - His spirit bowed; his will obeyed the law / Of its own nature binding even on Gods.

10.04_147:028 - The two opposed each other face to face.

10.04_147:029 - His being like a huge fort of darkness towered; / Around it her life grew, an ocean’s siege.

10.04_147:030 - Awhile the Shade survived defying heaven: / Assailing in front, oppressing from above / A concrete mass of conscious power, he bore / The tyranny of her divine desire.

10.04_147:031 - A pressure of intolerable force / Weighed on his unbowed head and stubborn breast; / Light like a burning tongue licked up his thoughts, / Light was a luminous torture in his heart, / Light coursed, a splendid agony, through his nerves; / His darkness muttered perishing in her blaze.

10.04_147:032 - Her mastering Word commanded every limb / And left no room for his enormous will / That seemed pushed out into some helpless space / And could no more re-enter but left him void.

10.04_147:033 - He called to Night but she fell shuddering back, / He called to Hell but sullenly it retired: / He turned to the Inconscient for support, / From which he was born, his vast sustaining self: / It drew him back towards boundless vacancy / As if by himself to swallow up himself: / He called to his strength, but it refused his call.

10.04_147:034 - His body was eaten by light, his spirit devoured.

10.04_147:035 - At last he knew defeat inevitable / And left crumbling the shape that he had worn, / Abandoning hope to make man’s soul his prey / And force to be mortal the immortal spirit.

10.04_147:036 - Afar he fled shunning her dreaded touch / And refuge took in the retreating Night.

10.04_147:037 - In the dream twilight of that symbol world / The dire universal Shadow disappeared / Vanishing into the Void from which it came.

10.04_147:038 - As if deprived of its original cause, / The twilight realm passed fading from their souls, / And Satyavan and Savitri were alone.

10.04_147:039 - But neither stirred: between those figures rose / A mute invisible and translucent wall.

10.04_147:040 - In the long blank moment’s pause nothing could move: / All waited on the unknown inscrutable Will.

Canto Book11 - 11: THE BOOK OF EVERLASTING DAY

Canto 1 - 11.1: The Eternal Day: The Soul's Choice and the Supreme Consummation

Section I - 148: triple mystic heaven


11.01_148:001 - A marvellous sun looked down from ecstasy’s skies / On worlds of deathless bliss, perfection’s home, / Magical unfoldings of the Eternal’s smile / Capturing his secret heart-beats of delight.

11.01_148:002 - God’s everlasting day surrounded her, / Domains appeared[5] of sempiternal light / Invading all Nature with the Absolute’s joy.

11.01_148:003 - Her body quivered with eternity’s touch, / Her soul stood close to the founts of the infinite.

11.01_148:004 - Infinity’s finite fronts she lived in, new / For ever to an everlasting sight.

11.01_148:005 - Eternity multiplied its vast self-look / Translating its endless mightiness and joy / Into delight souls playing with Time could share / In grandeurs ever new-born from the unknown depths, / In powers that leaped immortal from unknown heights, / In passionate heart-beats of an undying love, / In scenes of a sweetness that can never fade.

11.01_148:006 - Immortal to the rapturous heart and eyes, / In serene arches of translucent calm / From Wonder’s dream-vasts cloudless skies slid down / An abyss of sapphire; sunlight visited eyes / Which suffered without pain the absolute ray / And saw immortal clarities of form.

11.01_148:007 - Twilight and mist were exiles from that air, / Night was impossible to such radiant heavens.

11.01_148:008 - Firm in the bosom of immensity / Spiritual breadths were seen, sublimely born / From a still beauty of creative joy; / Embodied thoughts to sweet dimensions held / To please some carelessness of divine peace, / Answered the deep demand of an infinite sense / And its need of forms to house its bodiless thrill.

11.01_148:009 - A march of universal power in Time, / The harmonic order of self’s vastitudes / In cyclic symmetries and metric planes / Harboured a cosmic rapture’s revelry / In an endless figuring of the spirit in things / Planned by the artist who has dreamed the worlds; / Of all the beauty and the marvel here, / Of all Time’s intricate variety / Eternity was the substance and the source; / Not from a plastic mist of Matter made, / They offered the suggestion of their depths / And opened the great series of their powers.

11.01_148:010 - Arisen beneath a triple mystic heaven / The seven immortal earths were seen sublime: / Homes of the blest released from death and sleep / Where grief can never come nor any pang / Arriving from self-lost and seeking worlds / Alter Heaven-nature’s changeless quietude / And mighty posture of eternal calm, / Its pose of ecstasy immutable.

11.01_148:011 - Plains lay that seemed the expanse of God’s wide sleep, / Thought’s wings climbed up towards heaven’s vast repose / Lost in blue deeps of immortality.

11.01_148:012 - A changed earth-nature felt the breath of peace.

11.01_148:013 - Air seemed an ocean of felicity / Or the couch of the unknown spiritual rest, / A vast quiescence swallowing up all sound / Into a voicelessness of utter bliss; / Even Matter brought a close spiritual touch, / All thrilled with the immanence of one divine.

11.01_148:014 - The lowest of these earths was still a heaven / Translating into the splendour of things divine / The beauty and brightness of terrestrial scenes.

11.01_148:015 - Eternal mountains ridge on gleaming ridge / Whose lines were graved as on a sapphire plate / And etched the borders of heaven’s lustrous noon / Climbed like piled temple stairs and from their heads / Of topless meditation heard below / The approach of a blue pilgrim multitude / And listened to a great arriving voice / Of the wide travel hymn of timeless seas.

11.01_148:016 - A chanting crowd from mountain bosoms slipped / Past branches fragrant with a sigh of flowers / Hurrying through sweetnesses with revel leaps; / The murmurous rivers of felicity / Divinely rippled, honey-voiced desires, / Mingling their sister eddies of delight, / Then, widening to a pace of calm-lipped muse / Down many-glimmered estuaries of dream / Went whispering into lakes of liquid peace.

11.01_148:017 - On a brink held of senseless ecstasy / And guarding an eternal poise of thought / Sat sculptured souls dreaming by rivers of sound / In changeless attitudes of marble bliss.

11.01_148:018 - Around her lived the children of God’s day / In an unspeakable felicity, / A happiness never lost, the immortal’s ease, / A glad eternity’s blissful multitude.

11.01_148:019 - Around, the deathless nations moved and spoke, / Souls of a luminous celestial joy, / Faces of stark beauty, limbs of the moulded Ray; / In cities cut like gems of conscious stone / And wonderful pastures and on gleaming coasts / Bright forms were seen, eternity’s luminous tribes.

11.01_148:020 - Above her rhythming godheads whirled the spheres, / Rapt mobile fixities here blindly sought / By the huge erring orbits of our stars.

11.01_148:021 - Ecstatic voices smote at hearing’s chords, / Each movement found a music all its own; / Songs thrilled of birds upon unfading boughs, / The colours of whose plumage had been caught / From the rainbow of imagination’s wings.

11.01_148:022 - Immortal fragrance packed the quivering breeze, / In groves that seemed moved bosoms and trembling depths / The million children of the undying spring / Bloomed, pure unnumbered stars of hued delight / Nestling for shelter in their emerald sky: / Faery flower-masses looked with laughing eyes.

11.01_148:023 - A dancing chaos, an iridescent sea / Eternised to Heaven’s ever wakeful sight / The crowding petal-glow of marvel’s tints / Which float across the curtained lids of dream.

11.01_148:024 - Immortal harmonies filled her listening ear; / A great spontaneous utterance of the heights / On titan wings of rhythmic grandeur borne, / Poured from some deep spiritual heart of sound / Strains trembling with the secrets of the gods.

11.01_148:025 - A spirit wandered happily in the wind, / A spirit brooded in the leaf and stone; / The voices of thought-conscious instruments / Along a living verge of silence strayed, / And from some deep, a wordless tongue of things / Unfathomed, inexpressible, chantings rose / Translating into a voice the Unknown.

11.01_148:026 - A climber on the invisible stair of sound, / Music not with these few and striving steps / Aspired that wander upon transient strings, / But changed its ever new uncounted notes / In a passion of unforeseeing discovery, / And kept its old unforgotten ecstasies / A growing treasure in the mystic heart.

11.01_148:027 - A consciousness that yearned through every cry / Of unexplored attraction and desire, / It found and searched again the unsatisfied deeps / Hunting as if in some deep secret heart / To find some lost or missed felicity.

11.01_148:028 - In those far-lapsing symphonies she could hear / Breaking through enchantments of the ravished sense, / The lyric voyage of a divine soul / Mid spume and laughter tempting with its prow / The charm of innocent Circean isles, / Adventures without danger beautiful / In lands where siren Wonder sings its lures / From rhythmic rocks in ever-foaming seas.

11.01_148:029 - In the harmony of an original sight / Delivered from our limiting ray of thought, / And the reluctance of our blinded hearts / To embrace the Godhead in whatever guise, / She saw all Nature marvellous without fault.

11.01_148:030 - Invaded by beauty’s universal revel / Her being’s fibre reached out vibrating / And claimed deep union with its outer selves, / And on the heart’s chords made pure to seize all tones / Heaven’s subtleties of touch unwearying forced / More vivid raptures than earth’s life can bear.

11.01_148:031 - What would be suffering here, was fiery bliss.

11.01_148:032 - All here but passionate hint and mystic shade / Divined by the inner prophet who perceives / The spirit of delight in sensuous things, / Turned to more sweetness than can now be dreamed.

11.01_148:033 - The mighty signs of which earth fears the stress, / Trembling because she cannot understand, / And must keep obscure in forms strange and sublime, / Were here the first lexicon of an infinite mind / Translating the language of eternal bliss.

11.01_148:034 - Here rapture was a common incident; / The lovelinesses of whose captured thrill / Our human pleasure is a fallen thread, / Lay, symbol shapes, a careless ornament, / Sewn on the rich brocade of Godhead’s dress.

11.01_148:035 - Things fashioned were the imaged homes where mind / Arrived to fathom a deep physical joy; / The heart was a torch lit from infinity, / The limbs were trembling densities of soul.

11.01_148:036 - These were the first domains, the outer courts / Immense but least in range and least in price, / The slightest ecstasies of the undying gods.

11.01_148:037 - Higher her swing of vision swept and knew, / Admitted through large sapphire opening gates / Into the wideness of a light beyond, / These were but sumptuous decorated doors / To worlds nobler, more felicitously fair.

11.01_148:038 - Endless aspired the climbing of those heavens; / Realm upon realm received her soaring view.

11.01_148:039 - Then on what seemed one crown of the ascent / Where finite and the infinite are one, / Immune she beheld the strong immortals’ seats / Who live for a celestial joy and rule / The middle regions of the unfading Ray.

11.01_148:040 - Great forms of deities sat in deathless tiers, / Eyes of an unborn gaze towards her leaned / Through a transparency of crystal fire.

11.01_148:041 - In the beauty of bodies wrought from rapture’s lines, / Shapes of entrancing sweetness stilling bliss, / Feet glimmering upon the sun-stone courts of mind, / Heaven’s cup-bearers bore round the Eternal’s wine; / A tangle of bright bodies, of moved souls / Tracing the close and intertwined delight, / The harmonious tread of lives for ever joined / In the passionate oneness of a mystic joy / As if sun-beams made living and divine, / The golden-bosomed Apsara goddesses, / In groves flooded from an argent disk of bliss / That floated through a luminous sapphire dream, / In a cloud of raiment lit with golden limbs / And gleaming footfalls treading faery swards, / Virgin motions of bacchant innocences / Who know their riot for a dance of God / Whirled linked in moonlit revels of the heart.

11.01_148:042 - Impeccable artists of unerring forms, / Magician builders of sound and rhythmic words, / Wind-haired Gundhurvas chanted to the ear / The odes that shape the universal thought, / The lines that tear the veil from Deity’s face, / The rhythms that bring the sounds of wisdom’s sea.

11.01_148:043 - Immortal figures and illumined brows, / Our great forefathers in those splendours moved; / Termless in power and satisfied of light, / They enjoyed the sense of all for which we strive.

11.01_148:044 - High seers, moved poets saw the eternal thoughts / That, travellers from on high, arrive to us / Deformed by our search, tricked by costuming mind, / Like gods disfigured by the pangs of birth, / Seized the great words which now are frail sounds caught / By difficult rapture on a mortal tongue.

11.01_148:045 - The strong who stumble and sin were calm proud gods.

11.01_148:046 - There lightning-filled with glory and with flame, / Melting in waves of sympathy and sight, / Smitten like a lyre that throbs to others’ bliss, / Drawn by the cords of ecstasies unknown, / Her human nature faint with heaven’s delight, / She beheld the clasp to earth denied and bore / The imperishable eyes of veilless love, / More climbed above, level to level reached, / Beyond what tongue can utter or mind dream: / Worlds of an infinite reach crowned Nature’s stir.

11.01_148:047 - There was a greater tranquil sweetness there, / A subtler and profounder ether’s field / And mightier scheme than heavenliest sense can give.

11.01_148:048 - There breath carried a stream of seeing mind, / Form was a tenuous raiment of the soul: / Colour was a visible tone of ecstasy; / Shapes seen half immaterial by the gaze / And yet voluptuously palpable / Made sensible to touch the indwelling spirit.

11.01_148:049 - The high perfected sense illumined lived / A happy vassal of the inner ray, / Each feeling was the Eternal’s mighty child / And every thought was a sweet burning god.

11.01_148:050 - Air was a luminous feeling, sound a voice, / Sunlight the soul’s vision and moonlight its dream.

11.01_148:051 - On a wide living base of wordless calm / All was a potent and a lucid joy.

11.01_148:052 - Into those heights her spirit went floating up / Like an upsoaring bird who mounts unseen / Voicing to the ascent his throbbing heart / Of melody till a pause of closing wings / Comes quivering in his last contented cry / And he is silent with his soul discharged, / Delivered of his heart’s burden of delight.

11.01_148:053 - Experience mounted on joy’s coloured breast / To inaccessible spheres in spiral flight.

11.01_148:054 - There Time dwelt with Eternity as one; / Immense felicity joined rapt repose.



Section I - 149: virat


11.01_149:001 - As one drowned in a sea of splendour and bliss / Mute in the maze of these surprising worlds / Turning she saw their living knot and source, / Key to their charm and fount of their delight, / And knew him for the same who snares our lives / Captured in his terrifying pitiless net, / And makes the universe his prison camp / And makes in his immense and vacant vasts / The labour of the stars a circuit vain / And death the end of every human road / And grief and pain the wages of man’s toil.

11.01_149:002 - One whom her soul had faced as Death and Night / A sum of all sweetness gathered into his limbs / And blinded her heart to the beauty of the suns.

11.01_149:003 - Transfigured was the formidable shape.

11.01_149:004 - His darkness and his sad destroying might / Abolishing for ever and disclosing / The mystery of his high and violent deeds, / A secret splendour rose revealed to sight / Where once the vast embodied Void had stood.

11.01_149:005 - Night the dim mask had grown a wonderful face.

11.01_149:006 - The vague infinity was slain whose gloom / Had outlined from the terrible Unknown / The obscure disastrous figure of a god, / Fled was the error that arms the hands of grief, / And lighted the ignorant gulf whose hollow deeps / Had given to nothingness a dreadful voice.

11.01_149:007 - As when before the eye that wakes in sleep / Is opened the sombre binding of a book, / Illumined letterings are seen which kept / A golden blaze of thought inscribed within, / A marvellous form responded to her gaze / Whose sweetness justified life’s blindest pain; / All Nature’s struggle was its easy price, / The universe and its agony seemed worth while.

11.01_149:008 - As if the choric calyx of a flower / Aerial, visible on music’s waves, / A lotus of light-petalled ecstasy / Took shape out of the tremulous heart of things.

11.01_149:009 - There was no more the torment under the stars, / The evil sheltered behind Nature’s mask; / There was no more the dark pretence of hate, / The cruel ictus on Love’s altered face.

11.01_149:010 - Hate was the grip of a dreadful amour’s strife; / A ruthless love intent only to possess / Has here replaced the sweet original god; / Forgetting the Will-to-love that gave it birth, / The passion to lock itself in and to unite, / It would swallow all into one lonely self, / Devouring the soul that it had made its own, / By suffering and annihilation’s pain / Punishing the unwillingness to be one, / Angry with the refusals of the world, / Passionate to take but knowing not how to give.

11.01_149:011 - Death’s sombre cowl was cast from Nature’s brow; / There lightened on her the godhead’s lurking love.

11.01_149:012 - All grace and glory and all divinity / Were here collected in a single form; / All worshipped eyes looked through his from one face; / He bore all godheads in his grandiose limbs.

11.01_149:013 - An oceanic spirit dwelt within; / Intolerant and invincible in joy / A flood of freedom and transcendent bliss / Into immortal lines of beauty rose.

11.01_149:014 - In him the fourfold Being bore its crown / That wears the mystery of a nameless Name, / The universe writing its tremendous sense / In the inexhaustible meaning of a word.

11.01_149:015 - In him the architect of the visible world, / At once the art and artist of his works, / Spirit and seer and thinker of things seen, / Virât, who lights his camp-fires in the suns / And the star-entangled ether is his hold, / Expressed himself with Matter for his speech: / Objects are his letters, forces are his words, / Events are the crowded history of his life, / And sea and land are the pages of his tale, / Matter is his means and his spiritual sign; / He hangs the thought upon a lash’s lift, / In the current of the blood makes flow the soul.

11.01_149:016 - His is the dumb will of atom and of clod; / A Will that without sense or motive acts, / An Intelligence needing not to think or plan, / The world creates itself invincibly; / For its body is the body of the Lord / And in its heart stands Virat, King of kings.

11.01_149:017 - In him shadows his form the Golden Child / Who in the Sun-capped Vast cradles his birth: / Hiranyagarbha, author of thoughts and dream, / Who sees the invisible and hears the sounds / That never visited a mortal ear, / Discoverer of unthought realities, / Truer to Truth than all we have ever known, / He is the leader on the inner roads; / A seer, he has entered the forbidden realms; / A magician with the omnipotent wand of thought, / He builds the secret uncreated worlds.

11.01_149:018 - Armed with the golden speech, the diamond eye, / His is the vision and the prophecy: / Imagist casting the formless into shape, / Traveller and hewer of the unseen paths, / He is the carrier of the hidden fire, / He is the voice of the Ineffable, / He is the invisible hunter of the light, / The Angel of mysterious ecstasies, / The conqueror of the kingdoms of the soul.

11.01_149:019 - A third spirit stood behind, their hidden cause, / A mass of superconscience closed in light, / Creator of things in his all-knowing sleep.

11.01_149:020 - All from his stillness came as grows a tree; / He is our seed and core, our head and base.

11.01_149:021 - All light is but a flash from his closed eyes: / An all-wise Truth is mystic in his heart, / The omniscient Ray is shut behind his lids: / He is the Wisdom that comes not by thought, / His wordless silence brings the immortal word.

11.01_149:022 - He sleeps in the atom and the burning star, / He sleeps in man and god and beast and stone: / Because he is there the Inconscient does its work, / Because he is there the world forgets to die, / He is the centre of the circle of God, / He is the circumference of Nature’s run.

11.01_149:023 - His slumber is an Almightiness in things, / Awake, he is the Eternal and Supreme.

11.01_149:024 - Above was the brooding bliss of the Infinite, / Its omniscient and omnipotent repose, / Its immobile silence absolute and alone.

11.01_149:025 - All powers were woven in countless concords here.

11.01_149:026 - The bliss that made the world in his body lived.

11.01_149:027 - Love and delight were the head of the sweet form, / In the alluring meshes of their snare / Recaptured the proud blissful members held / All joys outrunners of the panting heart / And fugitive from life’s outstripped desire.

11.01_149:028 - Whatever vision has escaped the eye, / Whatever happiness comes in dream and trance, / The nectar spilled by love with trembling hands, / The joy the cup of Nature cannot hold, / Had crowded to the beauty of his face, / Were waiting in the honey of his laugh.

11.01_149:029 - Things hidden by the silence of the hours, / The ideas that find no voice on living lips, / The soul’s pregnant meeting with infinity / Had come to birth in him and taken fire: / The secret whisper of the flower and star / Revealed its meaning in his fathomless look.

11.01_149:030 - His lips curved eloquent like a rose of dawn; / His smile that played with the wonder of the mind / And stayed in the heart when it had left his mouth / Glimmered with the radiance of the morning star / Gemming the wide discovery of heaven.

11.01_149:031 - His gaze was the regard of eternity; / The spirit of its sweet and calm intent / Was a wise home of gladness and divulged / The light of the ages in the mirth of the hours, / A sun of wisdom in a miracled grove.

11.01_149:032 - In the orchestral largeness of his mind / All contrary seekings their close kinship knew, / Rich-hearted, wonderful to each other met / In the mutual marvelling of their myriad notes / And dwelt like brothers of one family / Who had found their common and mysterious home.

11.01_149:033 - As from the harp of some ecstatic god / There springs a harmony of lyric bliss / Striving to leave no heavenly joy unsung, / Such was the life in that embodied Light.

11.01_149:034 - He seemed the wideness of a boundless sky, / He seemed the passion of a sorrowless earth, / He seemed the burning of a world-wide sun.

11.01_149:035 - Two looked upon each other, Soul saw Soul.



Section I - 150: the inviolable Ecstasy


11.01_150:001 - Then like an anthem from the heart’s lucent cave / A voice soared up whose magic sound could turn / The poignant weeping of the earth to sobs / Of rapture and her cry to spirit song: / “O human image of the deathless word, / How hast thou seen beyond the topaz walls / The gleaming sisters of the divine gate, / Summoned the genii of their wakeful sleep, / And under revelation’s arches forced / The carved thought-shrouded doors to swing apart, / Unlocked the avenues of spiritual sight / And taught the entries of a heavenlier state / To thy rapt soul that bore the golden key?

11.01_150:002 - In thee the secret sight man’s blindness missed / Has opened its view past Time, my chariot course, / And death, my tunnel which I drive through life / To reach my unseen distances of bliss.

11.01_150:003 - I am the hushed search of the jealous gods / Pursuing my wisdom’s vast mysterious work / Seized in the thousand meeting ways of heaven.

11.01_150:004 - I am the beauty of the unveiled Ray / Drawing through the deep roads of the infinite night / The unconquerable pilgrim soul of earth / Beneath the flaring torches of the stars.

11.01_150:005t - I am the inviolable Ecstasy; / They who have looked on me, shall grieve no more. #ananda #apotheosis #divine-bliss #divine-effect #divine-grace #divine-revelation #divine-truth #divine-vision #god-as-bliss #transmutation-of-suffering

11.01_150:006 - The eyes that live in night shall see my form.

11.01_150:007 - On the pale shores of conscious foaming straits / That flow beneath a grey tormented sky / Two powers from one original ecstasy born / Pace near, but parted in the life of man; / One leans to earth, the other yearns to the skies: / Heaven in its rapture dreams of perfect earth, / Earth in its sorrow dreams of perfect heaven.

11.01_150:008 - The two longing to join, yet walk apart, / Idly divided by their vain conceits; / They are kept from their oneness by enchanted fears; / Sundered mysteriously by miles of thought, / They gaze across the silent gulfs of sleep.

11.01_150:009 - Or side by side reclined upon my vasts / Like bride and bridegroom magically divorced / They wake to yearn, but never can they clasp / While thinly flickering hesitates uncrossed / Between the lovers on their nuptial couch / The shadowy eidolon of a sword.

11.01_150:010 - But when the phantom flame-edge fails undone, / Then never more can space or time divide / The lover from the loved; space shall draw back / Her great translucent curtain. Time shall be / The quivering of the spirit’s endless bliss.

11.01_150:011 - Attend that moment of celestial fate.

11.01_150:012 - Meanwhile you two shall serve the dual law / Which only now the scouts of vision glimpse / Who pressing through the forest of their thoughts / Have found the narrow bridges of the gods.

11.01_150:013 - Wait patient of the brittle bars of form / Making division your delightful means / Of happy oneness rapturously enhanced / By attraction in the throbbing air between.

11.01_150:014 - Yet if thou wouldst abandon the vexed world / Careless of the dark moan of things below, / Tread down the isthmus, overleap the flood, / Cancel thy contract with the labouring Force, / Renounce the tie that joins thee to earth-kind, / Cast off thy sympathy with mortal hearts.

11.01_150:015 - Arise, vindicate thy spirit’s conquered right: / Relinquishing thy charge of transient breath, / Under the cold gaze of the indifferent stars / Leaving thy borrowed body on the sod, / Ascend, O soul, into thy blissful home.

11.01_150:016 - Here in the playground of the eternal Child / Or in domains the wise Immortals tread / Roam with thy comrade splendour under skies / Spiritual lit by an unsetting sun, / As godheads live who care not for the world / And share not in the toil of Nature’s powers: / Absorbed in their self-ecstasy they dwell.

11.01_150:017 - Cast off the ambiguous myth of earth’s desire, / O immortal to felicity arise."



Section I - 151: earth is the chosen place for the mightiest souls


11.01_151:001 - On Savitri listening in her tranquil heart / To the harmony of the ensnaring voice / A joy exceeding earth’s and heaven’s poured down / The bliss of an unknown eternity, / A rapture from some waiting Infinite.

11.01_151:002 - A smile came rippling out in her wide eyes, / Its confident felicity’s messenger / As if the first beam of the morning sun / Rippled along two wakened lotus-pools: / “O besetter of man’s soul with life and death / And the world’s pleasure and pain and Day and Night, / Tempting his heart with the far lure of heaven, / Testing his strength with the close touch of hell, / I climb not to thy everlasting Day, / Even as I have shunned thy eternal Night.

11.01_151:003 - To me who turn not from thy terrestrial Way, / Give back the other self my nature asks, / Thy spaces need him not to help their joy; / Earth needs his beautiful spirit made by thee / To fling delight down like a net of gold.

11.01_151:004 - Earth is the chosen place of mightiest souls; / Earth is the heroic spirit’s battlefield, / The forge where the Arch-mason shapes his works.

11.01_151:005 - Thy servitudes on earth are greater, king, / Than all the glorious liberties of heaven.

11.01_151:006 - The heavens were once to me my natural home, / I too have wandered in star-jewelled groves, / Paced sun-gold pastures and moon-silver swards / And heard the harping laughter of their streams / And lingered under branches dropping myrrh; / I too have revelled in the fields of light / Touched by the ethereal raiment of the winds, / Thy wonder-rounds of music I have trod, / Lived in the rhyme of bright unlabouring thoughts, / I have beat swift harmonies of rapture vast, / Danced in spontaneous measures of the soul / The great and easy dances of the gods.

11.01_151:007 - Oh, fragrant are the lanes thy children walk / And lovely is the memory of their feet / Amid the wonder-flowers of Paradise: / A heavier tread is mine, a mightier touch.

11.01_151:008 - There where the gods and demons battle in night / Or wrestle on the borders of the Sun, / Taught by the sweetness and the pain of life / To bear the uneven strenuous beat that throbs / Against the edge of some divinest hope, / To dare the impossible with these pangs of search, / In me the spirit of immortal love / Stretches its arms out to embrace mankind.

11.01_151:009 - Too far thy heavens for me from suffering men.

11.01_151:010 - Imperfect is the joy not shared by all.

11.01_151:011 - Oh to spread forth, oh to encircle and seize / More hearts till love in us has filled thy world!

11.01_151:012 - O life, the life beneath the wheeling stars / For victory in the tournament with death, / For bending of the fierce and difficult bow, / For flashing of the splendid sword of God!

11.01_151:013 - O thou who soundest the trumpet in the lists, / Part not the handle from the untried steel, / Take not the warrior with his blow unstruck.

11.01_151:014 - Are there not still a million fights to wage?

11.01_151:015 - O King-smith, clang on still thy toil begun, / Weld us to one in thy strong smithy of life.

11.01_151:016 - Thy fine-curved jewelled hilt call Savitri, / Thy blade’s exultant smile name Satyavan.

11.01_151:017 - Fashion to beauty, point us through the world.

11.01_151:018 - Break not the lyre before the song is found; / Are there not still unnumbered chants to weave?

11.01_151:019 - O subtle-souled musician of the years, / Play out what thou hast fluted on my stops; / Arise from the strain their first wild plaint divined / And that discover which is yet unsung.

11.01_151:020 - I know that I can lift man’s soul to God, / I know that he can bring the Immortal down.

11.01_151:021 - Our will labours permitted by thy will / And without thee an empty roar of storm, / A senseless whirlwind is the titan’s force / And without thee a snare the strength of gods.

11.01_151:022 - Let not the inconscient gulf swallow man’s race / That through earth’s ignorance struggles towards the Light.

11.01_151:023 - O thunderer with the lightnings of the soul, / Give not to darkness and to death thy sun, / Achieve thy wisdom’s hidden firm decree / And the mandate of thy secret world-wide love."

11.01_151:024 - Her words failed lost in thought’s immensities / Which seized them at the limits of their cry / And hid their meaning in the distances / That stir to more than ever speech has won / From the Unthinkable, end of all our thought, / And the Ineffable from whom all words come.


Section I - 152: the heroes and demi-gods are few


11.01_152:001 - Then with a smile august as noonday heavens / The godhead of the vision wonderful: / “How shall earth-nature and man’s nature rise / To the celestial levels, yet earth abide?

11.01_152:002 - Heaven and earth towards each other gaze / Across a gulf that few can cross, none touch, / Arriving through a vague ethereal mist / Out of which all things form that move in space, / The shore that all can see but never reach.

11.01_152:003 - Heaven’s light visits sometimes the mind of earth; / Its thoughts burn in her sky like lonely stars; / In her heart there move celestial seekings soft / And beautiful like fluttering wings of birds, / Visions of joy that she can never win / Traverse the fading mirror of her dreams.

11.01_152:004 - Faint seeds of light and bliss bear sorrowful flowers, / Faint harmonies caught from a half-heard song / Fall swooning mid the wandering voices’ jar, / Foam from the tossing luminous seas where dwells / The beautiful and far delight of gods, / Raptures unknown, a miracled happiness / Thrill her and pass half-shaped to mind and sense.

11.01_152:005 - Above her little finite steps she feels / Careless of knot or pause, worlds which weave out / A strange perfection beyond law and rule, / A universe of self-found felicity, / An inexpressible rhythm of timeless beats, / The many-movemented heart-beats of the One, / Magic of the boundless harmonies of self, / Order of the freedom of the infinite, / The wonder-plastics of the Absolute.

11.01_152:006 - There is the All-Truth and there the timeless bliss.

11.01_152:007 - But hers are fragments of a star-lost gleam, / Hers are but careless visits of the gods.

11.01_152:008 - They are a Light that fails, a Word soon hushed / And nothing they mean can stay for long on earth.

11.01_152:009 - There are high glimpses, not the lasting sight.

11.01_152:010 - A few can climb to an unperishing sun, / Or live on the edges of the mystic moon / And channel to earth-mind the wizard ray.

11.01_152:011 - The heroes and the demi-gods are few / To whom the close immortal voices speak / And to their acts the heavenly clan are near.

11.01_152:012 - Few are the silences in which Truth is heard, / Unveiling the timeless utterance in her deeps; / Few are the splendid moments of the seers.

11.01_152:013 - Heaven’s call is rare, rarer the heart that heeds; / The doors of light are sealed to common mind, / And earth’s needs nail to earth the human mass, / Only in an uplifting hour of stress / Men answer to the touch of greater things: / Or, raised by some strong hand to breathe heaven-air, / They slide back to the mud from which they climbed; / In the mud of which they are made, whose law they know / They joy in safe return to a friendly base, / And, though something in them weeps for the glory lost / And greatness murdered, they accept their fall.

11.01_152:014 - To be the common man they think the best, / To live as others live is their delight.

11.01_152:015 - For most are built on Nature’s earthly plan / And owe small debt to a superior plane; / The human average is their level pitch, / A thinking animal’s material range.

11.01_152:016 - In the long ever-mounting hierarchy, / In the stark economy of cosmic life / Each creature to its appointed task and place / Is bound by his nature’s form, his spirit’s force.

11.01_152:017 - If this were easily disturbed, it would break / The settled balance of created things; / The perpetual order of the universe / Would tremble, and a gap yawn in woven Fate.

11.01_152:018 - If men were not and all were brilliant gods, / The mediating stair would then be lost / By which the spirit awake in Matter winds / Accepting the circuits of the Middle Way, / By heavy toil and slow aeonic steps / Reaching the bright miraculous fringe of God, / Into the glory of the Oversoul.

11.01_152:019 - My will, my call is there in men and things; / But the Inconscient lies at the world’s grey back / And draws to its breast of Night and Death and Sleep.

11.01_152:020 - Imprisoned in its dark and dumb abyss / A little consciousness it lets escape / But jealous of the growing light holds back / Close to the obscure edges of its cave / As if a fond ignorant mother kept her child / Tied to her apron strings of Nescience.

11.01_152:021 - The Inconscient could not read without man’s mind / The mystery of the world its sleep has made: / Man is its key to unlock a conscious door.

11.01_152:022 - But still it holds him dangled in its grasp: / It draws its giant circle round its thoughts, / It shuts its heart to the supernal Light, / A high and dazzling limit shines above, / A black and blinding border rules below: / His mind is closed between two firmaments.

11.01_152:023 - He seeks through words and images the Truth, / And, poring on surfaces and brute outsides / Or dipping cautious feet in shallow seas, / Even his Knowledge is an Ignorance.

11.01_152:024 - He is barred out from his own inner depths; / He cannot look on the face of the Unknown.

11.01_152:025 - How shall he see with the Omniscient’s eyes, / How shall he will with the Omnipotent’s force?

11.01_152:026 - O too compassionate and eager Dawn, / Leave to the circling aeons’ tardy pace / And to the working of the inconscient Will, / Leave to its imperfect light the earthly race: / All shall be done by the long act of Time.

11.01_152:027 - Although the race is bound by its own kind, / The soul in man is greater than his fate: / Above the wash and surge of Time and Space, / Disengaging from the cosmic commonalty / By which all life is kin in grief and joy, / Delivered from the universal Law / The sun-like single and transcendent spirit / Can blaze its way through the mind’s barrier wall / And burn alone in the eternal sky, / Inhabitant of a wide and endless calm.

11.01_152:028 - O Flame, withdraw into thy luminous self / Or else return to thy original might / On a seer-summit above thought and world; / Partner of my unhoured eternity, / Be one with the infinity of my power: / For thou art the World Mother and the Bride.

11.01_152:029 - Out of the fruitless yearning of earth’s life, / Out of her feeble unconvincing dream, / Recovering wings that cross infinity / Pass back into the Power from which thou cam’st.

11.01_152:030 - To that thou canst uplift thy formless flight, / Thy heart can rise from its unsatisfied beats / And feel the immortal and spiritual joy / Of a soul that never lost felicity.

11.01_152:031 - Lift up the fallen heart of love which flutters, / Cast down desire’s abyss into the gulfs.

11.01_152:032 - For ever rescued out of Nature’s shapes / Discover what the aimless cycles want, / There intertwined with all thy life has meant, / Here vainly sought in a terrestrial form.

11.01_152:033 - Break into eternity thy mortal mould; / Melt, Lightning, into thy invisible flame.

11.01_152:034 - Clasp, Ocean, deep into thyself thy wave, / Happy for ever in the embosoming surge.

11.01_152:035 - Grow one with the still passion of the depths, / Then shalt thou know the Lover and the Loved, / Leaving the limits dividing him and thee.

11.01_152:036 - Receive him into boundless Savitri, / Lose thyself into infinite Satyavan, / O miracle where thou beganst there cease!"



Section I - 153: thy peace, O Lord


11.01_153:001 - But Savitri answered to the radiant God: / “In vain thou temptst with solitary bliss / Two spirits saved out of a suffering world; / My soul and his indissolubly linked / In the one task for which our lives were born / To raise the world to God in deathless Light, / To bring God down to the world on earth we came, / To change the earthly life to life divine.

11.01_153:002 - I keep my will to save the world and man; / Even the charm of thy alluring voice, / O blissful godhead, cannot seize and snare.

11.01_153:003 - I sacrifice not earth to happier worlds.

11.01_153:004 - Because there dwelt the Eternal’s vast Idea / And his dynamic will in men and things, / So only could the enormous scene begin.

11.01_153:005 - Whence came this profitless wilderness of stars, / This mighty barren wheeling of the suns?

11.01_153:006 - Who made the soul of futile life in Time, / Planted a purpose and a hope in the heart, / Set Nature to a huge and meaningless task / Or planned her million-aeoned effort’s waste?

11.01_153:007 - What force condemned to birth and death and tears / These conscious creatures crawling on the globe?

11.01_153:008 - If earth can look up to the light of heaven / And hear an answer to her lonely cry, / Not vain their meeting, nor heaven’s touch a snare.

11.01_153:009 - If thou and I are true, the world is true; / Although thou hide thyself behind thy works, / To be is not a senseless paradox; / Since God has made earth, earth must make in her God; / What hides within her breast she must reveal.

11.01_153:010 - I claim thee for the world that thou hast made.

11.01_153:011 - If man lives bound by his humanity, / If he is tied for ever to his pain, / Let a greater being then arise from man, / The superhuman with the Eternal mate / And the Immortal shine through earthly forms.

11.01_153:012 - Else were creation vain and this great world / A nothing that in Time’s moments seems to be.

11.01_153:013 - But I have seen through the insentient mask; / I have felt a secret spirit stir in things / Carrying the body of the growing God: / It looks through veiling forms at veilless truth, / It pushes back the curtain of the gods, / It climbs towards its own eternity."

11.01_153:014 - But the god answered to the woman’s heart: / “O living power of the incarnate Word, / All that the Spirit has dreamed thou canst create: / Thou art the force by which I made the worlds, / Thou art my vision and my will and voice.

11.01_153:015 - But knowledge too is thine, the world-plan thou knowest / And the tardy process of the pace of Time.

11.01_153:016 - In the impetuous drive of thy heart of flame, / In thy passion to deliver man and earth, / Indignant at the impediments of Time / And the slow evolution’s sluggard steps, / Lead not the spirit in an ignorant world / To dare too soon the adventure of the Light, / Pushing the bound and slumbering god in man / Awakened mid the ineffable silences / Into endless vistas of the unknown and unseen, / Across the last confines of the limiting Mind / And the Superconscient’s perilous border line / Into the danger of the Infinite.

11.01_153:017 - But if thou wilt not wait for Time and God, / Do then thy work and force thy will on Fate.

11.01_153:018 - As I have taken from thee my load of night / And taken from thee my twilight’s doubts and dreams, / So now I take my light of utter Day.

11.01_153:019 - These are my symbol kingdoms but not here / Can the great choice be made that fixes fate / Or uttered the sanction of the Voice supreme.

11.01_153:020 - Arise upon a ladder of greater worlds / To the infinity where no world can be.

11.01_153:021 - But not in the wide air where a greater Life / Uplifts its mystery and its miracle, / And not on the luminous peaks of summit Mind, / Or in the hold where subtle Matter’s spirit / Hides in its light of shimmering secrecies, / Can there be heard the Eternal’s firm command / That joins the head of destiny to its base.

11.01_153:022 - These only are the mediating links; / Not theirs is the originating sight / Nor the fulfilling act or last support / That bears perpetually the cosmic pile.

11.01_153:023 - Two are the Powers that hold the ends of Time; / Spirit foresees, Matter unfolds its thought, / The dumb executor of God’s decrees, / Omitting no iota and no dot, / Agent unquestioning, inconscient, stark, / Evolving inevitably a charged content, / Intention of his force in time and space, / In animate beings and inanimate things / Immutably it fulfils its ordered task.

11.01_153:024 - It cancels not a tittle of things done; / Unswerving from the oracular command / It alters not the steps of the Unseen.

11.01_153:025 - If thou must indeed deliver man and earth / On the spiritual heights, look down on life, / Discover the truth of God and man and world; / Then do thy task knowing and seeing all.

11.01_153:026 - Ascend, O soul, into thy timeless self; / Choose destiny’s curve and stamp thy will on Time."

11.01_153:027 - He ended and upon the falling sound / A power went forth that shook the founded spheres / And loosed the stakes that hold the tents of form.

11.01_153:028 - Absolved from vision’s grip and the folds of thought, / Rapt from her sense like disappearing scenes / In the stupendous theatre of Space / The heaven-worlds vanished in spiritual light.

11.01_153:029 - A movement was abroad, a cry, a word, / Beginningless in its vast discovery, / Momentless in its unthinkable return: / Choired in calm seas she heard the eternal Thought / Rhythming itself abroad unutterably / In spaceless orbits and on timeless roads.

11.01_153:030 - In an ineffable world she lived fulfilled.

11.01_153:031 - An energy of the triune Infinite, / In a measureless Reality she dwelt, / A rapture and a being and a force, / A linked and myriad-motioned plenitude, / A virgin unity, a luminous spouse, / Housing a multitudinous embrace / To marry all in God’s immense delight, / Bearing the eternity of every spirit, / Bearing the burden of universal love, / A wonderful mother of unnumbered souls.

11.01_153:032 - All things she knew, all things imagined or willed, / Her ear was opened to ideal sound, / Shape the convention bound no more her sight, / A thousand doors of oneness was her heart, / A crypt and sanctuary of brooding light / Appeared, the last recess of things beyond.

11.01_153:033 - Then in its round the enormous fiat paused, / Silence gave back to the Unknowable / All it had given. Still was her listening thought.

11.01_153:034 - The form of things had ceased within her soul.

11.01_153:035 - Invisible that perfect godhead now.

11.01_153:036 - Around her some tremendous spirit lived, / Mysterious flame around a melting pearl, / And in the phantom of abolished Space / There was a voice unheard by ears that cried: / “Choose, spirit, thy supreme choice not given again; / For now from my highest being looks at thee / The nameless formless peace where all things rest.

11.01_153:037 - In a happy vast sublime cessation know,— / An immense extinction in eternity, / A point that disappears in the infinite,— / Felicity of the extinguished flame, / Last sinking of a wave in a boundless sea, / End of the trouble of thy wandering thoughts, / Close of the journeying of thy pilgrim soul.

11.01_153:038 - Accept, O music, weariness of thy notes, / O stream, wide breaking of thy channel banks."

11.01_153:039 - The moments fell into eternity.

11.01_153:040 - But someone yearned within a bosom unknown.

11.01_153:041 - And silently the woman’s heart replied: / “Thy peace, O Lord, a boon within to keep / Amid the roar and ruin of wild Time / For the magnificent soul of man on earth.

11.01_153:042 - Thy calm, O Lord, that bears thy hands of joy."

11.01_153:043 - Limitless like ocean round a lonely isle / A second time the eternal cry arose: / “Wide open are the ineffable gates in front.

11.01_153:044 - My spirit leans down to break the knot of earth, / Amorous of oneness without thought or sign / To cast down wall and fence, to strip heaven bare, / See with the large eye of infinity, / Unweave the stars and into silence pass."

11.01_153:045 - In an immense and world-destroying pause / She heard a million creatures cry to her.

11.01_153:046 - Through the tremendous stillness of her thoughts / Immeasurably the woman’s nature spoke: / “Thy oneness, Lord, in many approaching hearts, / My sweet infinity of thy numberless souls."

11.01_153:047 - Mightily retreating like a sea in ebb / A third time swelled the great admonishing call: / “I spread abroad the refuge of my wings.

11.01_153:048 - Out of its incommunicable deeps / My power looks forth of mightiest splendour, stilled / Into its majesty of sleep, withdrawn / Above the dreadful whirlings of the world."

11.01_153:049 - A sob of things was answer to the voice, / And passionately the woman’s heart replied: / “Thy energy, Lord, to seize on woman and man, / To take all things and creatures in their grief / And gather them into a mother’s arms."

11.01_153:050 - Solemn and distant like a seraph’s lyre / A last great time the warning sound was heard: / “I open the wide eye of solitude / To uncover the voiceless rapture of my bliss, / Where in a pure and exquisite hush it lies / Motionless in its slumber of ecstasy, / Resting from the sweet madness of the dance / Out of whose beat the throb of hearts was borne."

11.01_153:051 - Breaking the silence with appeal and cry / A hymn of adoration tireless climbed, / A music beat of winged uniting souls, / Then all the woman yearningly replied: / “Thy embrace which rends the living knot of pain, / Thy joy, O Lord, in which all creatures breathe, / Thy magic flowing waters of deep love, / Thy sweetness give to me for earth and men."


Section I - 154: O beautiful body of the Incarnate word


11.01_154:001 - Then after silence a still blissful cry / Began, such as arose from the Infinite / When the first whisperings of a strange delight / Imagined in its deep the joy to seek, / The passion to discover and to touch, / The enamoured laugh which rhymed the chanting worlds: / “O beautiful body of the incarnate Word, / Thy thoughts are mine, I have spoken with thy voice.

11.01_154:002 - My will is thine, what thou hast chosen I choose.

11.01_154:003 - All thou hast asked I give to earth and men.

11.01_154:004 - All shall be written out in destiny’s book / By my trustee of thought and plan and act, / The executor of my will, eternal Time.

11.01_154:005 - But since thou hast refused my maimless Calm / And turned from my termless peace in which is expunged / The visage of Space, and the shape of Time is lost, / And from happy extinction of thy separate self / In my uncompanioned lone eternity,— / For not for thee the nameless worldless Nought, / Annihilation of thy living soul / And the end of thought and hope and life and love / In the blank measureless Unknowable,— / Because thou hast obeyed my timeless will / I lay my hands upon thy soul of flame, / I lay my hands upon thy heart of love, / I yoke thee to my power of work in Time.

11.01_154:006 - Because thou hast obeyed my timeless will, / Because thou hast chosen to share earth’s struggle and fate / And leaned in pity over earth-bound men / And turned aside to help and yearned to save, / I bind by thy heart’s passion thy heart to mine / And lay my splendid yoke upon thy soul.

11.01_154:007 - Now will I do in thee my marvellous works.

11.01_154:008 - I will fasten thy nature with my cords of strength, / Subdue to my delight thy spirit’s limbs / And make thee a vivid knot of all my bliss, / And build in thee my proud and crystal home.

11.01_154:009 - Thy days shall be my shafts of power and light, / Thy nights my starry mysteries of joy / And all my clouds lie tangled in thy hair / And all my springtides marry in thy mouth.

11.01_154:010 - O Sun-Word, thou shalt raise the earth-soul to Light / And bring down God into the lives of men; / Earth shall be my work-chamber and my house, / My garden of life to plant a seed divine.

11.01_154:011 - When all thy work in human time is done, / The mind of earth shall be a home of light, / The life of earth a tree growing towards heaven, / The body of earth a tabernacle of God.

11.01_154:012 - Awakened from the mortal’s ignorance / Men shall be lit with the Eternal’s ray / And the glory of my sun-lift in their thoughts / And feel in their hearts the sweetness of my love / And in their acts my Power’s miraculous drive.

11.01_154:013 - My will shall be the meaning of their days; / Living for me, by me, in me they shall live.

11.01_154:014 - In the heart of my creation’s mystery / I will enact the drama of thy soul, / Inscribe the long romance of Thee and Me.

11.01_154:015 - I will pursue thee across the century; / Thou shalt be hunted through the world by love, / Naked of ignorance’ protecting veil / And without covert from my radiant gods / No shape shall screen thee from my divine desire.

11.01_154:016 - Nowhere shalt thou escape my living eyes.

11.01_154:017 - In the nudity of thy discovered self / In a bare identity with all that is, / Disrobed of thy covering of humanity, / Divested of the dense veil of human thought, / Made one with every mind and body and heart, / Made one with all nature and with self and God, / Summing in thy single soul my mystic world / I will possess in thee my universe, / The universe find all I am in thee.

11.01_154:018 - Thou shalt bear all things that all things may change, / Thou shalt fill all with my splendour and my bliss, / Thou shalt meet all with my transmuting soul.

11.01_154:019 - Assailed by my infinitudes above, / And quivering in immensities below, / Pursued by me through my mind’s wall-less vast, / Oceanic with the surges of my life, / A swimmer lost between two leaping seas / By my outer pains and inner sweetnesses / Finding my joy in my opposite mysteries / Thou shalt respond to me from every nerve.

11.01_154:020 - A vision shall compel thy coursing breath, / Thy heart shall drive thee on the wheel of works, / Thy mind shall urge thee through the flames of thought, / To meet me in the abyss and on the heights, / To feel me in the tempest and the calm / And love me in the noble and the vile, / In beautiful things and terrible desire.

11.01_154:021 - The pains of hell shall be to thee my kiss, / The flowers of heaven persuade thee with my touch.

11.01_154:022 - My fiercest masks shall my attractions bring.

11.01_154:023 - Music shall find thee in the voice of swords, / Beauty pursue thee through the core of flame.

11.01_154:024 - Thou shalt know me in the rolling of the spheres / And cross me in the atoms of the whirl.

11.01_154:025 - The wheeling forces of my universe / Shall cry to thee the summons of my name.

11.01_154:026 - Delight shall drop down from my nectarous moon, / My fragrance seize thee in the jasmine’s snare, / My eye shall look upon thee from the sun.

11.01_154:027 - Mirror of Nature’s secret spirit made, / Thou shalt reflect my hidden heart of joy, / Thou shalt drink down my sweetness unalloyed / In my pure lotus-cup of starry brim.

11.01_154:028 - My dreadful hands laid on thy bosom shall force / Thy being bathed in fiercest longings’ streams.

11.01_154:029 - Thou shalt discover the one and quivering note / And cry, the harp of all my melodies, / And roll, my foaming wave in seas of love.

11.01_154:030 - Even my disasters’ clutch shall be to thee / The ordeal of my rapture’s contrary shape: / In pain’s self shall smile on thee my secret face: / Thou shalt bear my ruthless beauty unabridged / Amid the world’s intolerable wrongs, / Trampled by the violent misdeeds of Time / Cry out to the ecstasy of my rapture’s touch.

11.01_154:031 - All beings shall be to thy life my emissaries; / Drawn to me on the bosom of thy friend, / Compelled to meet me in thy enemy’s eyes, / My creatures shall demand me from thy heart.

11.01_154:032 - Thou shalt not shrink from any brother soul.

11.01_154:033 - Thou shalt be attracted helplessly to all.

11.01_154:034 - Men seeing thee shall feel my hands of joy, / In sorrow’s pangs feel steps of the world’s delight, / Their life experience its tumultuous shock / In the mutual craving of two opposites.

11.01_154:035 - Hearts touched by thy love shall answer to my call, / Discover the ancient music of the spheres / In the revealing accents of thy voice, / And nearer draw to me because thou art: / Enamoured of thy spirit’s loveliness / They shall embrace my body in thy soul, / Hear in thy life the beauty of my laugh, / Know the thrilled bliss with which I made the worlds.

11.01_154:036 - All that thou hast, shall be for other’s bliss, / All that thou art, shall to my hands belong.

11.01_154:037 - I will pour delight from thee as from a jar, / I will whirl thee as my chariot through the ways, / I will use thee as my sword and as my lyre, / I will play on thee my minstrelsies of thought.

11.01_154:038 - And when thou art vibrant with all ecstasy, / And when thou livst one spirit with all things, / Then will I spare thee not my living fires, / But make thee a channel for my timeless force.

11.01_154:039 - My hidden presence led thee unknowing on / From thy beginning in earth’s voiceless bosom / Through life and pain and time and will and death, / Through outer shocks and inner silences / Along the mystic roads of Space and Time / To the experience which all Nature hides.

11.01_154:040 - Who hunts and seizes me, my captive grows: / This shalt thou henceforth learn from thy heart-beats.

11.01_154:041 - For ever love, O beautiful slave of God!

11.01_154:042 - O lasso of my rapture’s widening noose, / Become my cord of universal love.

11.01_154:043 - The spirit ensnared by thee force to delight / Of creation’s oneness sweet and fathomless, / Compelled to embrace my myriad unities / And all my endless forms and divine souls.

11.01_154:044 - O Mind, grow full of the eternal peace; / O Word, cry out the immortal litany: / Built is the golden tower, the flame-child born.



Section I - 155


11.01_155:001 - “Descend to life with him thy heart desires.

11.01_155:002 - O Satyavan, O luminous Savitri, / I sent you forth of old beneath the stars, / A dual power of God in an ignorant world, / In a hedged creation shut from limitless self, / Bringing down God to the insentient glow, / Lifting earth-beings to immortality.

11.01_155:003 - In the world of my knowledge and my ignorance / Where God is unseen and only is heard a Name / And knowledge is trapped in the boundaries of mind / And life is hauled in the drag-net of desire / And Matter hides the soul from its own sight, / You are my Force at work to uplift earth’s fate, / My self that moves up the immense incline / Between the extremes of the spirit’s night and day.

11.01_155:004 - He is my soul that climbs from nescient Night / Through life and mind and supernature’s Vast / To the supernal light of Timelessness / And my eternity hid in moving Time / And my boundlessness cut by the curve of Space.

11.01_155:005 - It climbs to the greatness it has left behind / And to the beauty and joy from which it fell, / To the closeness and sweetness of all things divine, / To light without bounds and life illimitable, / Taste of the depths of the Ineffable’s bliss, / Touch of the immortal and the infinite.

11.01_155:006 - He is my soul that gropes out of the beast / To reach humanity’s heights of lucent thought, / And the vicinity of Truth’s sublime.

11.01_155:007 - He is the godhead growing in human lives / And in the body of earth-being’s forms, / He is the soul of man climbing to God / In Nature’s surge out of earth’s ignorance.

11.01_155:008 - O Savitri, thou art my spirit’s Power, / The revealing voice of my immortal Word, / The face of Truth upon the roads of Time / Pointing to the souls of men the routes to God.

11.01_155:009 - While the dim light from the veiled Spirit’s peak / Falls upon Matter’s stark inconscient sleep / As if a pale moonbeam on a dense glade, / And Mind in a half-light moves amid half-truths / And the human heart knows only human love / And life is a stumbling and imperfect force / And the body counts out its precarious days, / You shall be born into man’s dubious hours / In forms that hide the soul’s divinity / And show through veils of the earth’s doubting air / My glory breaking as through clouds a sun, / Or burning like a rare and inward fire, / And with my nameless influence fill men’s lives.

11.01_155:010 - Yet shall they look up as to peaks of God / And feel God like a circumambient air / And rest on God as on a motionless base.

11.01_155:011 - Yet shall there glow on mind like a horned moon / The spirit’s crescent splendour in pale skies / And light man’s life upon his Godward road.

11.01_155:012 - But more there is concealed in God’s Beyond / That shall one day reveal its hidden face.

11.01_155:013 - Now mind is all and its uncertain ray, / Mind is the leader of the body and life, / Mind the thought-driven chariot of the soul / Carrying the luminous wanderer in the night / To vistas of a far uncertain dawn, / To the end of the Spirit’s fathomless desire, / To its dream of absolute truth and utter bliss.

11.01_155:014 - There are greater destinies mind cannot surmise / Fixed on the summit of the evolving Path / The Traveller now treads in the Ignorance, / Unaware of his next step, not knowing his goal.

11.01_155:015 - Mind is not all his tireless climb can reach, / There is a fire on the apex of the worlds, / There is a house of the Eternal’s Light.

11.01_155:016 - There is an infinite truth, an absolute power.

11.01_155:017 - The spirit’s mightiness shall cast off its mask; / Its greatness shall be felt shaping the world’s course.

11.01_155:018 - It shall be seen in its own veilless beams, / A star rising from the Inconscient’s night, / A sun climbing to Supernature’s peak.

11.01_155:019 - Abandoning the dubious Middle Way / A few shall glimpse the miraculous Origin / And some shall feel in you the secret Force / And they shall turn to meet a nameless tread, / Adventurers into a mightier Day.

11.01_155:020 - Ascending out of the limiting breadths of mind, / They shall discover the world’s huge design / And step into the Truth, the Right, the Vast.

11.01_155:021 - You shall reveal to them the hidden eternities, / The breath of infinitudes not yet revealed, / Some rapture of the bliss that made the world, / Some rush of the force of God’s omnipotence, / Some beam of the omniscient Mystery.

11.01_155:022 - But when the hour of the Divine draws near, / The Mighty Mother shall take birth in Time / And God be born into the human clay / In forms made ready by your human lives.

11.01_155:023 - Then shall the Truth supreme be given to men.

11.01_155:024 - There is a being beyond the being of mind, / An Immeasurable cast into many forms, / A miracle of the multitudinous One.

11.01_155:025 - There is a consciousness mind cannot touch, / Its speech cannot utter nor its thought reveal.

11.01_155:026 - It has no home on earth, no centre in man, / Yet is the source of all things thought and done, / The fount of the creation and its works.

11.01_155:027 - It is the originer of all truth here, / The sun-orb of mind’s fragmentary rays, / Infinity’s heaven that spills the rain of God, / The Immense that calls to man to expand the Spirit / The wide Aim that justifies his narrow attempts, / A channel for the little he tastes of bliss.

11.01_155:028 - Some shall be made the glory’s receptacles / And vehicles of the Eternal’s luminous power.

11.01_155:029 - These are the high forerunners, the heads of Time, / The great deliverers of earth-bound mind, / The high transfigurers of human clay, / The first-born of a new supernal race.

11.01_155:030 - The incarnate dual Power shall open God’s door, / Eternal supermind touch earthly Time.

11.01_155:031 - The superman shall wake in mortal man / And manifest the hidden demi-god / Or grow into the God-Light and God-Force / Revealing the secret deity in the cave.

11.01_155:032 - Then shall the earth be touched by the Supreme, / His bright unveiled Transcendence shall illumine / The mind and heart, and force the life and act / To interpret his inexpressible mystery / In a heavenly alphabet of Divinity’s signs.

11.01_155:033 - His living cosmic spirit shall enring, / Annulling the decree of death and pain, / Erasing the formulas of the Ignorance, / With the deep meaning of beauty and life’s hid sense, / The being ready for immortality, / His regard crossing infinity’s mystic waves / Bring back to Nature her early joy to live, / The metred heart-beats of a lost delight, / The cry of a forgotten ecstasy, / The dance of the first world-creating Bliss.

11.01_155:034 - The Immanent shall be the witness God / Watching on his many-petalled lotus-throne, / His actionless being and his silent might / Ruling earth-nature by eternity’s law, / A thinker waking the Inconscient’s world, / An immobile centre of many infinitudes / In his thousand-pillared temple by Time’s sea.

11.01_155:035 - Then shall the embodied being live as one / Who is a thought, a will of the Divine, / A mask or robe of his divinity, / An instrument and partner of his Force, / A point or line drawn in the infinite, / A manifest of the Imperishable.

11.01_155:036 - The supermind shall be his nature’s fount, / The Eternal’s truth shall mould his thoughts and acts, / The Eternal’s truth shall be his light and guide.

11.01_155:037 - All then shall change, a magic order come / Overtopping this mechanical universe.

11.01_155:038 - A mightier race shall inhabit the mortal’s world.

11.01_155:039 - On Nature’s luminous tops, on the Spirit’s ground, / The superman shall reign as king of life, / Make earth almost the mate and peer of heaven / And lead towards God and truth man’s ignorant heart / And lift towards godhead his mortality.

11.01_155:040 - A power released from circumscribing bounds, / Its height pushed up beyond death’s hungry reach, / Life’s tops shall flame with the Immortal’s thoughts, / Light shall invade the darkness of its base.

11.01_155:041 - Then in the process of evolving Time / All shall be drawn into a single plan, / A divine harmony shall be earth’s law, / Beauty and Joy remould her way to live: / Even the body shall remember God, / Nature shall draw back from mortality / And Spirit’s fires shall guide the earth’s blind force; / Knowledge shall bring into the aspirant Thought / A high proximity to Truth and God.

11.01_155:042 - The supermind shall claim the world for Light / And thrill with love of God the enamoured heart / And place Light’s crown on Nature’s lifted head / And found Light’s reign on her unshaking base.

11.01_155:043 - A greater truth than earth’s shall roof-in earth / And shed its sunlight on the roads of mind; / A power infallible shall lead the thought, / A seeing Puissance govern life and act, / In earthly hearts kindle the Immortal’s fire.

11.01_155:044 - A soul shall wake in the Inconscient’s house; / The mind shall be God-vision’s tabernacle, / The body intuition’s instrument, / And life a channel for God’s visible power.

11.01_155:045 - All earth shall be the Spirit’s manifest home, / Hidden no more by the body and the life, / Hidden no more by the mind’s ignorance; / An unerring Hand shall shape event and act.

11.01_155:046 - The Spirit’s eyes shall look through Nature’s eyes, / The Spirit’s force shall occupy Nature’s force.

11.01_155:047 - This world shall be God’s visible garden-house, / The earth shall be a field and camp of God, / Man shall forget consent to mortality / And his embodied frail impermanence.

11.01_155:048 - This universe shall unseal its occult sense, / Creation’s process change its antique front, / An ignorant evolution’s hierarchy / Release the Wisdom chained below its base.

11.01_155:049 - The Spirit shall be the master of his world / Lurking no more in form’s obscurity / And Nature shall reverse her action’s rule, / The outward world disclose the Truth it veils; / All things shall manifest the covert God, / All shall reveal the Spirit’s light and might / And move to its destiny of felicity.

11.01_155:050 - Even should a hostile force cling to its reign / And claim its right’s perpetual sovereignty / And man refuse his high spiritual fate, / Yet shall the secret Truth in things prevail.

11.01_155:051 - For in the march of all-fulfilling Time / The hour must come of the Transcendent’s will: / All turns and winds towards his predestined ends / In Nature’s fixed inevitable course / Decreed since the beginning of the worlds / In the deep essence of created things: / Even there shall come as a high crown of all / The end of Death, the death of Ignorance.

11.01_155:052 - But first high Truth must set her feet on earth / And man aspire to the Eternal’s light / And all his members feel the Spirit’s touch / And all his life obey an inner Force.

11.01_155:053 - This too shall be; for a new life shall come, / A body of the Superconscient’s truth, / A native field of Supernature’s mights: / It shall make earth’s nescient ground Truth’s colony, / Make even the Ignorance a transparent robe / Through which shall shine the brilliant limbs of Truth / And Truth shall be a sun on Nature’s head / And Truth shall be the guide of Nature’s steps / And Truth shall gaze out of her nether deeps.

11.01_155:054 - When superman is born as Nature’s king / His presence shall transfigure Matter’s world: / He shall light up Truth’s fire in Nature’s night, / He shall lay upon the earth Truth’s greater law; / Man too shall turn towards the Spirit’s call.

11.01_155:055 - Awake to his hidden possibility, / Awake to all that slept within his heart / And all that Nature meant when earth was formed / And the Spirit made this ignorant world his home, / He shall aspire to Truth and God and Bliss.

11.01_155:056 - Interpreter of a diviner law / And instrument of a supreme design / The higher kind shall lean to lift up man.

11.01_155:057 - Man shall desire to climb to his own heights.

11.01_155:058 - The truth above shall wake a nether truth; / Even the dumb earth become a sentient force.

11.01_155:059 - The Spirit’s tops and Nature’s base shall draw / Near to the secret of their separate truth / And know each other as one deity.

11.01_155:060 - The Spirit shall look out through Matter’s gaze / And Matter shall reveal the Spirit’s face.

11.01_155:061 - Then man and superman shall be at one / And all the earth become a single life.

11.01_155:062 - Even the multitude shall hear the Voice / And turn to commune with the Spirit within / And strive to obey the high spiritual law: / This earth shall stir with impulses sublime, / Humanity awake to deepest self, / Nature the hidden godhead recognise.

11.01_155:063 - Even the many shall some answer make / And bear the splendour of the Divine’s rush / And his impetuous knock at unseen doors.

11.01_155:064 - A heavenlier passion shall upheave men’s lives, / Their mind shall share in the ineffable gleam, / Their heart shall feel the ecstasy and the fire, / Earth’s bodies shall be conscious of a soul; / Mortality’s bond-slaves shall unloose their bonds, / Mere men into spiritual beings grow / And see awake the dumb divinity.

11.01_155:065 - Intuitive beams shall touch the nature’s peaks, / A revelation stir the nature’s depths: / The Truth shall be the leader of their lives, / Truth shall dictate their thought and speech and act, / They shall feel themselves lifted nearer to the sky, / As if a little lower than the gods.

11.01_155:066 - For knowledge shall pour down its radiant streams / And even darkened mind quiver with new life / And kindle and burn with the Ideal’s fire / And turn to escape from mortal ignorance.

11.01_155:067 - The frontiers of the Ignorance shall recede, / More and more souls shall enter into light, / Minds lit, inspired, the occult summoner hear / And lives blaze with a sudden inner flame / And hearts grow enamoured of divine delight / And human wills tune to the divine will, / These separate selves the Spirit’s oneness feel, / These senses of heavenly sense grow capable, / The flesh and nerves of a strange ethereal joy / And mortal bodies of immortality.

11.01_155:068 - A divine force shall flow through tissue and cell / And take the charge of breath and speech and act / And all the thoughts shall be a glow of suns / And every feeling a celestial thrill.

11.01_155:069 - Often a lustrous inner dawn shall come / Lighting the chambers of the slumbering mind; / A sudden bliss shall run through every limb / And Nature with a mightier Presence fill.

11.01_155:070 - Thus shall the earth open to divinity / And common natures feel the wide uplift, / Illumine common acts with the Spirit’s ray / And meet the deity in common things.

11.01_155:071 - Nature shall live to manifest secret God, / The Spirit shall take up the human play, / This earthly life become the life divine."



Section I - 156: she was buried in a mother's breast


11.01_156:001 - The measure of that subtle music ceased.

11.01_156:002 - Down with a hurried swimming floating lapse / Through unseen worlds and bottomless spaces forced / Sank like a star the soul of Savitri.

11.01_156:003 - Amidst a laughter of unearthly lyres / She heard around her nameless voices cry / Triumphing, an innumerable sound.

11.01_156:004 - A choir of laughing winds to meet her came.

11.01_156:005 - She bore the burden of infinity / And felt the stir of all ethereal space.

11.01_156:006 - Pursuing her in her fall, implacably sweet, / A face was over her which seemed a youth’s, / Symbol of all the beauty eyes see not, / Crowned as with peacock plumes of gorgeous hue / Framing a sapphire, whose heart-disturbing smile / Insatiably attracted to delight, / Voluptuous to the embraces of her soul.

11.01_156:007 - Changed in its shape, yet rapturously the same, / It grew a woman’s dark and beautiful / Like a mooned night with drifting star-gemmed clouds, / A shadowy glory and a stormy depth, / Turbulent in will and terrible in love.

11.01_156:008 - Eyes in which Nature’s blind ecstatic life / Sprang from some spirit’s passionate content, / Missioned her to the whirling dance of earth.

11.01_156:009 - Amidst the headlong rapture of her fall / Held like a bird in a child’s satisfied hands, / In an enamoured grasp her spirit strove / Admitting no release till Time should end, / And, as the fruit of the mysterious joy, / She kept within her strong embosoming soul / Like a flower hidden in the heart of spring / The soul of Satyavan drawn down by her / Inextricably in that mighty lapse.

11.01_156:010 - Invisible heavens in a thronging flight / Soared past her as she fell. Then all the blind / And near attraction of the earth compelled / Fearful rapidities of downward bliss.

11.01_156:011 - Lost in the giddy proneness of that speed, / Whirled, sinking, overcome she disappeared / Like a leaf spinning from the tree of heaven, / In broad unconsciousness as in a pool; / A hospitable softness drew her in / Into a wonder of miraculous depths, / Above her closed a darkness of great wings / And she was buried in a mother’s breast.

11.01_156:012 - Then from a timeless plane that watches Time, / A Spirit gazed out upon destiny, / In its endless moment saw the ages pass.

11.01_156:013 - All still was in a silence of the gods.

11.01_156:014 - The prophet moment covered limitless space / And cast into the heart of hurrying Time / A diamond light of the Eternal’s peace, / A crimson seed of God’s felicity; / A glance from the gaze fell of undying Love.

11.01_156:015 - A wonderful face looked out with deathless eyes; / A hand was seen drawing the golden bars / That guard the imperishable secrecies.

11.01_156:016 - A key turned in a mystic lock of Time.

11.01_156:017 - But where the silence of the gods had passed, / A greater harmony from the stillness born / Surprised with joy and sweetness yearning hearts, / An ecstasy and a laughter and a cry.

11.01_156:018 - A power leaned down, a happiness found its home.

11.01_156:019 - Over wide earth brooded the infinite bliss.

Canto Book12 - 12: EPILOGUE

Canto 1 - 1: The Return to Earth

Section 157 - 157

12.01_157:001 - Out of abysmal trance her spirit woke.

12.01_157:002 - Lain on the earth-mother’s calm inconscient breast / She saw the green-clad branches lean above / Guarding her sleep with their enchanted life, / And overhead a blue-winged ecstasy / Fluttered from bough to bough with high-pitched call.

12.01_157:003 - Into the magic secrecy of the woods / Peering through an emerald lattice-window of leaves, / In indolent skies reclined, the thinning day / Turned to its slow fall into evening’s peace.

12.01_157:004 - She pressed the living body of Satyavan: / On her body’s wordless joy to be and breathe / She bore the blissful burden of his head / Between her breasts’ warm labour of delight, / The waking gladness of her members felt / The weight of heaven in his limbs, a touch / Summing the whole felicity of things, / And all her life was conscious of his life / And all her being rejoiced enfolding his.

12.01_157:005 - The immense remoteness of her trance had passed; / Human she was once more, earth’s Savitri, / Yet felt in her illimitable change.

12.01_157:006 - A power dwelt in her soul too great for earth, / A bliss lived in her heart too large for heaven.

12.01_157:007 - Light too intense for thought and love too boundless / For earth’s emotions lit her skies of mind / And spread through her deep and happy seas of soul.

12.01_157:008 - All that is sacred in the world drew near / To her divine passivity of mood.

12.01_157:009 - A marvellous voice of silence breathed its thoughts.

12.01_157:010 - All things in time and space she had taken for hers; / In her they moved, by her they lived and were, / The whole wide world clung to her for delight, / Created for her rapt embrace of love.

12.01_157:011 - Now in her spaceless self released from bounds / Unnumbered years seemed moments long drawn out, / The brilliant time-flakes of eternity.

12.01_157:012 - Outwingings of a bird from its bright home, / Her earthly morns were radiant flights of joy.

12.01_157:013 - Boundless she was, a form of infinity.

12.01_157:014 - Absorbed no longer by the moment’s beat / Her spirit the unending future felt / And lived with all the unbeginning past.

12.01_157:015 - Her life was a dawn’s victorious opening, / The past and unborn days had joined their dreams, / Old vanished eves and far arriving noons / Hinted to her a vision of prescient hours.

12.01_157:016 - Supine in musing bliss she lay awhile / Given to the wonder of a waking trance; / Half-risen then she sent her gaze around, / As if to recover old sweet trivial threads, / Old happy thoughts, small treasured memories, / And weave them into one immortal day.

12.01_157:017 - Ever she held on the paradise of her breast / Her lover charmed into a fathomless sleep, / Lain like an infant spirit unaware / Lulled on the verge of two consenting worlds.

12.01_157:018 - But soon she leaned down over her loved to call / His mind back to her with her travelling touch / On his closed eyelids; settled was her still look / Of strong delight, not yearning now, but large / With limitless joy or sovereign last content, / Pure, passionate with the passion of the gods.

12.01_157:019 - Desire stirred not its wings; for all was made / An overarching of celestial rays / Like the absorbed control of sky on plain, / Heaven’s leaning down to embrace from all sides earth, / A quiet rapture, a vast security.

12.01_157:020 - Then sighing to her touch the soft-winged sleep / Rose hovering from his flower-like lids and flew / Murmurous away. Awake, he found her eyes / Waiting for his, and felt her hands, and saw / The earth his home given back to him once more / And her made his again, his passion’s all.

12.01_157:021 - With his arms’ encircling hold around her locked, / A living knot to make possession close, / He murmured with hesitating lips her name, / And vaguely recollecting wonder cried, / “Whence hast thou brought me captive back, love-chained, / To thee and sun-light’s walls, O golden beam / And casket of all sweetness, Savitri, / Godhead and woman, moonlight of my soul?

12.01_157:022 - For surely I have travelled in strange worlds / By thee companioned, a pursuing spirit, / Together we have disdained the gates of night; / I have turned away from the celestial’s joy / And heaven’s insufficient without thee.

12.01_157:023 - Where now has passed that formidable Shape / Which rose against us? the Spirit of the Void, / Claiming the world for Death and Nothingness, / Denying God and Soul? Or was all a dream / Or a vision seen in a spiritual sleep, / A symbol of the oppositions of Time / Or a mind-lit beacon of significance / In some stress of darkness lighting on the Way / Or guiding a swimmer through the straits of Death, / Or finding with the succour of its ray / In a gully mid the crowded streets of Chance / The soul that into the world-adventure came, / A scout and voyager from Eternity?"

12.01_157:024 - But she replied, “Our parting was the dream; / We are together, we live, O Satyavan.

12.01_157:025 - Look round thee and behold, glad and unchanged / Our home, this forest, with its thousand cries / And the whisper of the wind among the leaves / And, through rifts in emerald scene, the evening sky, / God’s canopy of blue sheltering our lives, / And the birds crying for heart’s happiness, / Winged poets of our solitary reign, / Our friends on earth where we are king and queen.

12.01_157:026 - Only our souls have left Death’s night behind / Changed by a mighty dream’s reality, / Illumined by the light of symbol worlds / And the stupendous summit self of things, / And stood at Godhead’s gates limitless, free."

12.01_157:027 - Then filled with the glory of their happiness / They rose and with safe clinging fingers locked / Hung on each other in a silent look.

12.01_157:028 - But he with a new wonder in his heart / And a new flame of worship in his eyes: / “What high change is in thee, O Savitri? Bright / Ever thou wast, a goddess still and pure, / Yet dearer to me by thy sweet human parts / Earth gave thee making thee yet more divine.

12.01_157:029 - My adoration mastered, my desire / Bent down to make its subject, my daring clasped, / Claiming by body and soul my life’s estate, / Rapture’s possession, love’s sweet property, / A statue of silence in my templed spirit, / A yearning godhead and a golden bride.

12.01_157:030 - But now thou seemst almost too high and great / For mortal worship; Time lies below thy feet / And the whole world seems only a part of thee, / Thy presence the hushed heaven I inhabit, / And thou lookst on me in the gaze of the stars, / Yet art the earthly keeper of my soul, / My life a whisper of thy dreaming thoughts, / My morns a gleaming of thy spirit’s wings, / And day and night are of thy beauty part.

12.01_157:031 - Hast thou not taken my heart to treasure it / In the secure environment of thy breast?

12.01_157:032 - Awakened from the silence and the sleep, / I have consented for thy sake to be.

12.01_157:033 - By thee I have greatened my mortal arc of life, / But now far heaven’s unmapped infinitudes / Thou hast brought me thy illimitable gift.

12.01_157:034 - If to fill these thou lift thy sacred flight, / My human earth will still demand thy bliss: / Make still my life through thee a song of joy / And all my silence wide and deep with thee."

12.01_157:035 - A heavenly queen consenting to his will, / She clasped his feet by her enshrining hair / Enveloped in a velvet cloak of love, / And answered softly like a murmuring lute: / “All now is changed, yet all is still the same.

12.01_157:036 - Lo, we have looked upon the face of God, / Our life has opened with divinity.

12.01_157:037 - We have borne identity with the Supreme / And known his meaning in our mortal lives.

12.01_157:038 - Our love has grown greater by that mighty touch / And learnt its heavenly significance, / Yet nothing is lost of mortal love’s delight.

12.01_157:039 - Heaven’s touch fulfils but cancels not our earth: / Our bodies need each other in the same last; / Still in our breasts repeat heavenly secret rhythm / Our human heart-beats passionately close.

12.01_157:040 - Still am I she who came to thee mid the murmur / Of sunlit leaves upon this forest verge; / I am the Madran, I am Savitri.

12.01_157:041 - All that I was before, I am to thee still, / Close comrade of thy thoughts and hopes and toils, / All happy contraries I would join for thee.

12.01_157:042 - All sweet relations marry in our life, / I am thy kingdom even as thou art mine, / The sovereign and the slave of thy desire, / Thy prone possessor, the sister of thy soul / And mother of thy wants; thou art my world, / The earth I need, the heaven my thoughts desire, / The world I inhabit and the god I adore.

12.01_157:043 - Thy body is my body’s counterpart / Whose every limb my answering limb desires, / Whose heart is key to all my heart-beats,—this / I am and thou to me, O Satyavan.

12.01_157:044 - Our wedded walk through life begins anew, / No gladness lost, no depth of mortal joy; / Let us go through this new world that is the same.

12.01_157:045 - For it is given back, but it is known, / A playing ground and dwelling house of God / Who hides himself in bird and beast and man / Sweetly to find himself again by love, / By oneness. His presence leads the rhythms of life / That seek for mutual joy in spite of pain.

12.01_157:046 - We have each other found, O Satyavan, / In the great light of the discovered soul.

12.01_157:047 - Let us go back, for eve is in the skies.

12.01_157:048 - Now grief is dead and serene bliss remains / The heart of all our days for ever more.

12.01_157:049 - Lo, all these beings in this wonderful world!

12.01_157:050 - Let us give joy to all, for joy is ours.

12.01_157:051 - For not for ourselves alone our spirits came / Out of the veil of the Unmanifest, / Out of the deep immense Unknowable / On the ignorant breast of dubious earth / Into the ways of labouring, seeking men, / Two fires that burn towards that parent Sun, / Two rays that travel to the original Light.

12.01_157:052 - To lead man’s soul towards Truth and God we are born, / To draw the chequered scheme of mortal life / Into some semblance of the Immortal’s plan, / To shape it closer to an image of God, / A little nearer to the Idea divine."

12.01_157:053 - She closed her arms about his breast and head / As if to keep him on her bosom worn / For ever through the journeying of the years.

12.01_157:054 - So for a while they stood entwined, their kiss / And passion-tranced embrace a meeting point / In their commingling spirits, one for ever, / Two-souled, two-bodied for the joys of time.

12.01_157:055 - Then hand in hand they left that solemn place / Full now of mute unusual memories, / To the green distance of their sylvan home / Returning slowly through the forest’s heart: / Round them the afternoon to evening changed; / Light slipped down to the brightly sleeping verge, / And the birds came back winging to their nests, / And day and night leaned to each other’s arms.



Section 158 - 158: that to feel love and oneness is to live


12.01_158:001 - Now the dusk shadowy trees stood close around / Like dreaming spirits and delaying night, / The grey-eyed pensive evening heard their steps, / And from all points the cries and movements came / Of the four-footed wanderers of the night / Approaching. Then a human rumour rose / Long alien to their solitary days, / Invading the charmed wilderness of leaves, / Once sacred to secluded loneliness, / With violent breaking of its virgin sleep.

12.01_158:002 - Through the screened dusk it deepened still and there neared / Floating of many voices and the sound / Of many feet till on their sight broke in, / As if a coloured wave upon the eye, / The brilliant strenuous crowded life of man.

12.01_158:003 - Topped by a flaring multitude of lights / A great resplendent company arrived.

12.01_158:004 - Life in its ordered tumult wavering came / Bringing its stream of unknown faces, thronged / With gold-fringed headdresses, gold-broidered robes, / Glittering of ornaments, fluttering of hems, / Hundreds of hands parted the forest-boughs, / Hundreds of eyes searched the entangled glades.

12.01_158:005 - Calm white-clad priests their grave-eyed sweetness brought, / Strong warriors in their glorious armour shone, / The proud-hooved steeds came trampling through the wood.

12.01_158:006 - In front King Dyumathsena walked, no more / Blind, faltering limbed, but his far-questing eyes / Restored to all their confidence in light / Took seeingly this imaged outer world; / Firmly he trod with monarch steps the soil.

12.01_158:007 - By him that queen and mother’s anxious face / Came changed from its habitual burdened look / Which in its drooping strength of tired toil / Had borne the fallen life of those she loved.

12.01_158:008 - Her patient paleness wore a pensive glow / Like evening’s subdued gaze of gathered light / Departing, which foresees sunrise her child.

12.01_158:009 - The brilliance of her rich receding gleam / A thoughtful prophecy of lyric dawn, / She lives awhile to muse upon that hope / Sinking in quiet splendours of her sky.

12.01_158:010 - Her eyes were first to find her children’s forms.

12.01_158:011 - But at the vision of the beautiful twain / The air awoke perturbed with scaling cries, / And the swift parents hurrying to their child,— / Their cause of life now who had given him breath,— / Possessed him with their arms. Then tenderly / Cried Dyumathsena chiding Satyavan: / “The fortunate gods have looked on me today, / A kingdom seeking came and heaven’s rays.

12.01_158:012 - But where wast thou? Thou hast tormented gladness / With fear’s dull shadow, O my child, my life.

12.01_158:013 - What danger kept thee for the darkening woods?

12.01_158:014 - Or how could pleasure in her ways forget / That useless orbs without thee are my eyes / Which only for thy sake rejoice at light.

12.01_158:015 - Not like thyself was this done, Savitri, / Who ledst not back thy husband to our arms, / Knowing with him beside me only is taste / In food and for his touch evening and morn / I live content with my remaining days."

12.01_158:016 - But Satyavan replied with smiling lips, / “Lay all on her; she is the cause of all.

12.01_158:017 - With her enchantments she has twined me round.

12.01_158:018 - Behold, at noon leaving this house of clay / I wandered in far-off eternities, / Yet still, a captive in her golden hands, / I tread your little hillock called green earth / And in the moments of your transient sun / Live glad among the busy works of men."

12.01_158:019 - Then all eyes turned their wondering looks where stood / A deepening redder gold upon her cheeks, / With lowered lids the noble lovely child, / And one consenting thought moved every breast: / “What gleaming marvel of the earth or skies / Stands silently by human Satyavan / To mark a brilliance in the dusk of eve?

12.01_158:020 - If this is she of whom the world has heard, / Wonder no more at any happy change.

12.01_158:021 - Each easy miracle of felicity / Of her transmuting heart the alchemy is."

12.01_158:022 - Then one spoke there who seemed a priest and sage, / “O woman soul, what light, what power revealed, / Working the rapid marvels of this day, / Opens for us by thee a happier age?"

12.01_158:023 - Her lashes fluttering upwards gathered in / To a vision which had scanned immortal things, / Rejoicing, human forms for their delight.

12.01_158:024 - They claimed for their deep childlike motherhood / The life of all these souls to be her life, / Then falling veiled the light. Low she replied, / “Awakened to the meaning of my heart / That to feel love and oneness is to live / And this the magic of our golden change / Is all the truth I know or seek, O sage."

12.01_158:025 - Wondering at her and her too luminous words / Westward they turned in the fast gathering night.


Section I - 159: in her bosom nursed a greater dawn


12.01_159:001 - From the entangling verges freed they came / Into a dimness of the sleeping earth / And travelled through her faint and slumbering plains.

12.01_159:002 - Murmur and movement and the tread of men / Broke the night’s solitude. The neigh of steeds / Rose from the indistinct and voiceful sea / Of life and all along its marchings swelled / The rhyme of hooves, the chariot’s homeward voice.

12.01_159:003 - Drawn by white manes upon a high-roofed car / In flare of the unsteady torches went / With linked hands Satyavan and Savitri, / Hearing a marriage march and nuptial hymn, / Where waited them the many-voiced human world.

12.01_159:004 - Numberless the stars swam on their shadowy field / Describing in the gloom the ways of light.

12.01_159:005 - Then while they skirted yet the southward verge, / Lost in the halo of her musing brows / Night, splendid with the moon dreaming in heaven / In silver peace, possessed her luminous reign.

12.01_159:006 - She brooded through her stillness on a thought / Deep-guarded by her mystic folds of light, / And in her bosom nursed a greater dawn.
